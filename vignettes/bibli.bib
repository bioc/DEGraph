  abstract = {Recently, methods have been developed in the field of Artificial Intelligence
	(AI), specifically in the expert systems area using rule-induction,
	designed to extract rules from data. We have applied these methods
	to the analysis of molecular series with the objective of generating
	rules which are predictive and reliable. The input to rule-induction
	consists of a number of examples with known outcomes (a training
	set) and the output is a tree-structured series of rules. Unlike
	most other analysis methods, the results of the analysis are in the
	form of simple statements which can be easily interpreted. These
	are readily applied to new data giving both a classification and
	a probability of correctness. Rule-induction has been applied to
	in-house generated and published QSAR datasets and the methodology,
	application and results of these analyses are discussed. The results
	imply that in some cases it would be advantageous to use rule-induction
	as a complementary technique in addition to conventional statistical
	and pattern-recognition methods.},

  title = {Robust biomarker identification for cancer diagnosis with ensemble
	feature selection methods.},
  journal = {Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},
  month = {Nov},
  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Biomarker discovery is an important topic in biomedical
	applications of computational biology, including applications such
	as gene and SNP selection from high dimensional data. Surprisingly,
	the stability with respect to sampling variation or robustness of
	such selection processes has received attention only recently. However,
	robustness of biomarkers is an important issue, as it may greatly
	influence subsequent biological validations. In addition, a more
	robust set of markers may strengthen the confidence of an expert
	in the results of a selection method. RESULTS: Our first contribution
	is a general framework for the analysis of the robustness of a biomarker
	selection algorithm. Secondly, we conducted a large-scale analysis
	of the recently introduced concept of ensemble feature selection,
	where multiple feature selections are combined in order to increase
	the robustness of the final set of selected features. We focus on
	selection methods that are embedded in the estimation of support
	vector machines (SVMs). SVMs are powerful classification models that
	have shown state-of-the-art performance on several diagnosis and
	prognosis tasks on biological data. Their feature selection extensions
	also offered good results for gene selection tasks. We show that
	the robustness of SVMs for biomarker discovery can be substantially
	increased by using ensemble feature selection techniques, while at
	the same time improving upon classification performances. The proposed
	methodology is evaluated on four microarray data sets showing increases
	of up to almost 30\% in robustness of the selected biomarkers, along
	with an improvement of about 15\% in classification performance.
	The stability improvement with ensemble methods is particularly noticeable
	for small signature sizes (a few tens of genes), which is most relevant
	for the design of a diagnosis or prognosis model from a gene signature.

  journal = {J. Chem. Inf. Comput. Sci.},
  year = {2003},
  volume = {43},
  pages = {458--468},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Pharmacophore triplets and quartets have been used by many groups
	in recent years, primarily as a tool for molecular diversity analysis.
	In most cases, slow processing speeds and the very large size of
	the bitsets generated have forced researchers to compromise in terms
	of how such multiplets were stored, manipulated, and compared, e.g.,
	by using simple unions to represent multiplets for sets of molecules.
	Here we report using bitmaps in place of bitsets to reduce storage
	demands and to improve processing speed. Here, a bitset is taken
	to mean a fully enumerated string of zeros and ones, from which a
	compressed bitmap is obtained by replacing uniform blocks ("runs")
	of digits in the bitset with a pair of values identifying the content
	and length of the block (run-length encoding compression). High-resolution
	multiplets involving four features are enabled by using 64 bit executables
	to create and manipulate bitmaps, which "connect" to the 32 bit executables
	used for database access and feature identification via an extensible
	mark-up language (XML) data stream. The encoding system used supports
	simple pairs, triplets, and quartets; multiplets in which a privileged
	substructure is used as an anchor point; and augmented multiplets
	in which an additional vertex is added to represent a contingent
	feature such as a hydrogen bond extension point linked to a complementary
	feature (e.g., a donor or an acceptor atom) in a base pair or triplet.
	It can readily be extended to larger, more complex multiplets as
	well. Database searching is one particular potential application
	for this technology. Consensus bitmaps built up from active ligands
	identified in preliminary screening can be used to generate hypothesis
	bitmaps, a process which includes allowance for differential weighting
	to allow greater emphasis to be placed on bits arising from multiplets
	expected to be particularly discriminating. Such hypothesis bitmaps
	are shown to be useful queries for database searching, successfully
	retrieving active compounds across a range of structural classes
	from a corporate database. The current implementation allows multiconformer
	bitmaps to be obtained from pregenerated conformations or by random
	perturbation on-the-fly. The latter application involves random sampling
	of the full range of conformations not precluded by steric clashes,
	which limits the usefulness of classical fingerprint similarity measures.
	A new measure of similarity, The Stochastic Cosine, is introduced
	here to address this need. This new similarity measure uses the average
	number of bits common to independently drawn conformer sets to normalize
	the cosine coefficient. Its use frees the user from having to ensure
	strict comparability of starting conformations and having to use
	fixed torsional increments, thereby allowing fully flexible characterization
	of pharmacophoric patterns.},

  pages = {55},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Regions of interest identified through genetic linkage
	studies regularly exceed 30 centimorgans in size and can contain
	hundreds of genes. Traditionally this number is reduced by matching
	functional annotation to knowledge of the disease or phenotype in
	question. However, here we show that disease genes share patterns
	of sequence-based features that can provide a good basis for automatic
	prioritization of candidates by machine learning. RESULTS: We examined
	a variety of sequence-based features and found that for many of them
	there are significant differences between the sets of genes known
	to be involved in human hereditary disease and those not known to
	be involved in disease. We have created an automatic classifier called
	PROSPECTR based on those features using the alternating decision
	tree algorithm which ranks genes in the order of likelihood of involvement
	in disease. On average, PROSPECTR enriches lists for disease genes
	two-fold 77\% of the time, five-fold 37\% of the time and twenty-fold
	11\% of the time. CONCLUSION: PROSPECTR is a simple and effective
	way to identify genes involved in Mendelian and oligogenic disorders.
	It performs markedly better than the single existing sequence-based
	classifier on novel data. PROSPECTR could save investigators looking
	at large regions of interest time and effort by prioritizing positional
	candidate genes for mutation detection and case-control association

	solutions, from large scale data analyses to theoretical modeling.
	Within the theoretical models Boolean networks occupy an increasing

	and hypotheses into a mathematical formalism. The conceptual underpinnings
	of Boolean modeling are very accessible even without a background
	in quantitative sciences, yet it allows life scientists to describe
	and explore a wide range of surprisingly complex phenomena. In this
	paper we provide a clear overview of the concepts used in Boolean
	simulations, present a software library that can perform these simulations
	based on simple text inputs and give three case studies. The large
	scale simulations in these case studies demonstrate the Boolean paradigms
	and their applicability as well as the advanced features and complex
	use cases that our software package allows. Our software is distributed

	transiently contacts single-stranded RNA nonspecifically and promotes

	Therefore, the settings of the parameters are quite often left at

	statistical experimental design and subsequent regression based on

	design. The PLS models showed quantitative relationships between
	the docking parameters and the ability of the programs to reproduce

	polychemotherapy [cyclophosphamide, methotrexate, 5-fluorouracil

	TP53 mutations were found in 105 patients (28\%). We found 90 (82\%)
	of the 110 mutations in the more frequently analysed exons 5-8, while
	the other 20 (18\%) were located in exons 3-4 and 9-10, respectively.
	Univariate analyses showed TP53 to be a significant prognostic factor

	In particular, their ability to fit biological activity surfaces,
	predict activity, and determine the "functional forms" of its dependence
	on physical properties is compared to well-established methods in
	the field. A dataset of 256 5-phenyl-3,4-diamino-6,6-dimethyldihydrotriazines

	for a significant part of the variance in linear regression models.
	Additionally, they lead to the elucidation of nonlinear and "cross-products"
	effects that correspond to trade-offs between physical properties
	in their effect on biological activity. This is the first demonstration
	of the latter two findings. On the other hand, due to the complexity
	of the resulting models, an understanding of the local, but not the

	of their results. The structural methods are data-independent, but
	are quite time-consuming and thus not suited for screening of whole
	genomes. Here, we present a new method, which performs sequence-based
	prediction by incorporating information obtained from molecular modeling.
	This allows us to perform large databases screening and to provide
	structural information of the results. RESULTS: We developed a SVM-trained,
	quantitative matrix-based method for the prediction of MHC class
	I binding peptides, in which the features of the scoring matrix are
	energy terms retrieved from molecular dynamics simulations. At the
	same time we used the equilibrated structures obtained from the same
	simulations in a simple and efficient docking procedure. Our method
	consists of two steps: First, we predict potential binders from sequence
	data alone and second, we construct protein-peptide complexes for
	the predicted binders. So far, we tested our approach on the HLA-A0201
	allele. We constructed two prediction models, using local, position-dependent
	(DynaPred(POS)) and global, position-independent (DynaPred) features.
	The former model outperformed the two sequence-based methods used
	in our evaluation; the latter shows a much higher generalizability
	towards other alleles than the position-dependent models. The constructed
	peptide structures can be refined within seconds to structures with
	an average backbone RMSD of 1.53 A from the corresponding experimental
	structures.},

	following {DNA} and proteins. {T}hey are extremely vital for the
	functioning of multicellular organisms. {H}owever, comparing the
	fast development of sequence analysis techniques, informatics work
	on glycans have a long way to go. {A}lignment algorithms for glycan
	tree structures are one of the foremost concerns. {I}n addition,
	the statistical analysis of these algorithms in terms of biological
	significance needs to be addressed. {RESULTS}: {W}e developed a tree-structure
	alignment algorithm for glycans and performed a statistical analysis
	of these alignment scores such that biologically interesting features
	could be captured into a score matrix for glycans. {W}e generated
	our score matrix in a manner similar to {BLOSUM}, but with slight
	variations to accomodate our glycan data, including the incorporation
	of linkage information. {W}e verified the effectiveness of our new
	glycan score matrix by illustrating how well the resulting score
	matrix entries correspond with biological knowledge. {F}uture work
	for even better improvements with the use of a variety of score matrices
	for different subclasses of glycans due to their complexity is also

	you to find the cheapest route by which to visit all the cities and
	return home to where you began. Though seemingly modest, this exercise
	has inspired studies by mathematicians, chemists, and physicists.
	Teachers use it in the classroom. It has practical applications in
	genetics, telecommunications, and neuroscience.
	
	The authors of this book are the same pioneers who for nearly two
	decades have led the investigation into the traveling salesman problem.
	They have derived solutions to almost eighty-six thousand cities,
	yet a general solution to the problem has yet to be discovered. Here
	they describe the method and computer code they used to solve a broad
	range of large-scale problems, and along the way they demonstrate
	the interplay of applied mathematics with increasingly powerful computing
	platforms. They also give the fascinating history of the problem--how
	it developed, and why it continues to intrigue us.},

	corneal compensation ({GD}x-{VCC}), and optical coherence tomography
	({OCT}) of the macula, peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer ({RNFL}),

	algorithms are developed for solving clustering, feature selection

	is considerably reduced by feature selection. {W}e propose a classification

	of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins is of interest in current
	bioinformatics research. {S}everal methods have been applied so far
	for this task, utilizing different algorithmic techniques and a number
	of freely available predictors exist. {T}he methods can be grossly
	divided to those based on {H}idden {M}arkov {M}odels ({HMM}s), on
	{N}eural {N}etworks ({NN}s) and on {S}upport {V}ector {M}achines
	({SVM}s). {I}n this work, we compare the different available methods
	for topology prediction of beta-barrel outer membrane proteins. {W}e
	evaluate their performance on a non-redundant dataset of 20 beta-barrel
	outer membrane proteins of gram-negative bacteria, with structures
	known at atomic resolution. {A}lso, we describe, for the first time,
	an effective way to combine the individual predictors, at will, to
	a single consensus prediction method. {RESULTS}: {W}e assess the
	statistical significance of the performance of each prediction scheme
	and conclude that {H}idden {M}arkov {M}odel based methods, {HMM}-{B}2{TMR},
	{P}rof{TMB} and {PRED}-{TMBB}, are currently the best predictors,
	according to either the per-residue accuracy, the segments overlap
	measure ({SOV}) or the total number of proteins with correctly predicted
	topologies in the test set. {F}urthermore, we show that the available
	predictors perform better when only transmembrane beta-barrel domains
	are used for prediction, rather than the precursor full-length sequences,
	even though the {HMM}-based predictors are not influenced significantly.
	{T}he consensus prediction method performs significantly better than
	each individual available predictor, since it increases the accuracy
	up to 4\% regarding {SOV} and up to 15\% in correctly predicted topologies.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {T}he consensus prediction method described in this
	work, optimizes the predicted topology with a dynamic programming
	algorithm and is implemented in a web-based application freely available

	networks of two species are aligned by assigning proteins to sequence
	homology clusters using the Inparanoid algorithm. Next, probabilistic

	is ambiguous when sequence similarity is used alone. In 61 of these

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {T}here has been great expectation that the knowledge
	of an individual's genotype will provide a basis for assessing susceptibility
	to diseases and designing individualized therapy. {N}on-synonymous
	single nucleotide polymorphisms (ns{SNP}s) that lead to an amino
	acid change in the protein product are of particular interest because
	they account for nearly half of the known genetic variations related
	to human inherited diseases. {T}o facilitate the identification of
	disease-associated ns{SNP}s from a large number of neutral ns{SNP}s,
	it is important to develop computational tools to predict the phenotypic
	effects of ns{SNP}s. {RESULTS}: {W}e prepared a training set based
	on the variant phenotypic annotation of the {S}wiss-{P}rot database
	and focused our analysis on ns{SNP}s having homologous 3{D} structures.
	{S}tructural environment parameters derived from the 3{D} homologous
	structure as well as evolutionary information derived from the multiple
	sequence alignment were used as predictors. {T}wo machine learning
	methods, support vector machine and random forest, were trained and
	evaluated. {W}e compared the performance of our method with that
	of the {SIFT} algorithm, which is one of the best predictive methods
	to date. {A}n unbiased evaluation study shows that for ns{SNP}s with
	sufficient evolutionary information (with not <10 homologous sequences),
	the performance of our method is comparable with the {SIFT} algorithm,
	while for ns{SNP}s with insufficient evolutionary information (<10
	homologous sequences), our method outperforms the {SIFT} algorithm
	significantly. {T}hese findings indicate that incorporating structural
	information is critical to achieving good prediction accuracy when
	sufficient evolutionary information is not available. {AVAILABILITY}:

	question of how much sequencing is required to detect rearrangement
	breakpoints and to localize them precisely using both theoretical

	a fusion gene exists in a cancer genome given a collection of paired-end

	that we are able to accurately predict fusion genes in these samples

	demonstrate how the ability to detect fusion genes depends on the

	of a sequencing strategy impact breakpoint detection, breakpoint
	localization, and fusion gene detection, even in the presence of

	manner. The target RNA species may be the products of transgenes,
	endogenous plant genes or viral RNAs. For an RNA to be a target it
	is necessary only that it has sequence homology to the sense RNA
	product of the transgene. There are three current hypotheses to account
	for the mechanism of post transcriptional gene silencing. These models
	all require production of an antisense RNA of the RNA targets to
	account for the specificity of the mechanism. There could be either
	direct transcription of the antisense RNA from the transgene, antisense
	RNA produced in response to over expression of the transgene or antisense
	RNA produced in response to the production of an aberrant sense RNA
	product of the transgene. To determine which of these models is correct
	it will be necessary to find out whether transgene methylation, which
	is frequently associated with the potential of transgenes to confer
	post-transcriptional gene silencing, is a cause or a consequence
	of the process.},

	and exploit it for object recognition. In our framework, the measurement
	of similarity is preceded by: (1) solving for correspondences between
	points on the two shapes; (2) using the correspondences to estimate
	an aligning transform. In order to solve the correspondence problem,
	we attach a descriptor, the shape context, to each point. The shape
	context at a reference point captures the distribution of the remaining
	points relative to it, thus offering a globally discriminative characterization.
	Corresponding points on two similar shapes will have similar shape
	contexts, enabling us to solve for correspondences as an optimal
	assignment problem. Given the point correspondences, we estimate
	the transformation that best aligns the two shapes; regularized thin-plate
	splines provide a flexible class of transformation maps for this
	purpose. The dissimilarity between the two shapes is computed as
	a sum of matching errors between corresponding points, together with
	a term measuring the magnitude of the aligning transform. We treat
	recognition in a nearest-neighbor classification framework as the
	problem of finding the stored prototype shape that is maximally similar
	to that in the image. Results are presented for silhouettes, trademarks,

  abstract = {Unforeseen adverse effects exhibited by drugs contribute heavily to
	late-phase failure and even withdrawal of marketed drugs. Torsade
	de pointes (TdP) is one such important adverse effect, which causes
	cardiac arrhythmia and, in some cases, sudden death, making it crucial
	for potential drugs to be screened for torsadogenicity. The need
	to tap the power of computational approaches for the prediction of
	adverse effects such as TdP is increasingly becoming evident. The
	availability of screening data including those in organized databases
	greatly facilitates exploration of newer computational approaches.
	In this paper, we report the development of a prediction method based
	on a support machine vector algorithm. The method uses a combination
	of descriptors, encoding both the type of toxicophore as well as
	the position of the toxicophore in the drug molecule, thus considering
	both the pharmacophore and the three-dimensional shape information
	of the molecule. For delineating toxicophores, a novel pattern-recognition
	method that utilizes substructures within a molecule has been developed.
	The results obtained using the hybrid approach have been compared
	with those available in the literature for the same data set. An
	improvement in prediction accuracy is clearly seen, with the accuracy
	reaching up to 97\% in predicting compounds that can cause TdP and
	90\% for predicting compounds that do not cause TdP. The generic
	nature of the method has been demonstrated with four data sets available
	for carcinogenicity, where prediction accuracies were significantly
	higher, with a best receiver operating characteristics (ROC) value
	of 0.81 as against a best ROC value of 0.7 reported in the literature
	for the same data set. Thus, the method holds promise for wide applicability

	X-ray structure of bovine rhodopsin, homology models of an "antagonist-bound"
	form of three human GPCRs (dopamine D3 receptor, muscarinic M1 receptor,
	vasopressin V1a receptor) were constructed. The homology models were
	used to screen three-dimensional databases using three different
	docking programs (Dock, FlexX, Gold) in combination with seven scoring
	functions (ChemScore, Dock, FlexX, Fresno, Gold, Pmf, Score). Rhodopsin-based
	homology models turned out to be suitable, indeed, for virtual screening
	since known antagonists seeded in the test databases could be distinguished
	from randomly chosen molecules. However, such models are not accurate
	enough for retrieving known agonists. To generate receptor models
	better suited for agonist screening, we developed a new knowledge-
	and pharmacophore-based modeling procedure that might partly simulate
	the conformational changes occurring in the active site during receptor
	activation. Receptor coordinates generated by this new procedure
	are now suitable for agonist screening. We thus propose two alternative
	strategies for the virtual screening of GPCR ligands, relying on
	a different set of receptor coordinates (antagonist-bound and agonist-bound

	from many different points of view with varying degrees of success.
	In particular, predicting new edges with a reasonable false discovery
	rate is highly demanded for practical applications, but remains extremely
	challenging due to the sparsity of the networks of interest. RESULTS:
	While most previous approaches based on the partial knowledge of
	the network to be inferred build global models to predict new edges
	over the network, we introduce here a novel method which predicts
	whether there is an edge from a newly added vertex to each of the
	vertices of a known network using local models. This involves learning
	individually a certain subnetwork associated with each vertex of
	the known network, then using the discovered classification rule
	associated with only that vertex to predict the edge to the new vertex.
	Excellent experimental results are shown in the case of metabolic
	and protein-protein interaction network reconstruction from a variety
	of genomic data. AVAILABILITY: An implementation of the proposed

  abstract = {Array-Based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) is a method used

	regions of constant copy number. Subjects sharing the same disease
	status, for example a type of cancer, often have aCGH profiles with
	similar copy number variations, due to duplications and deletions
	relevant to that particular disease. We introduce a constrained optimization
	algorithm that jointly segments aCGH profiles of many subjects. It
	simultaneously penalizes the amount of freedom the set of profiles
	have to jump from one level of constant copy number to another, at
	genomic locations known as breakpoints. We show that breakpoints

	can be formulated as a group LARS problem. We propose an extremely

	in order of importance. For no extra cost the algorithm smoothes
	all of the aCGH profiles into piecewise-constant regions of equal

  abstract = {This paper describes a virtual screening methodology that generates
	a ranked list of high-binding small molecule ligands for orphan G
	protein-coupled receptors (oGPCRs), circumventing the requirement
	for receptor three-dimensional structure determination. Features
	representing the receptor are based only on physicochemical properties
	of primary amino acid sequence, and ligand features use the two-dimensional
	atomic connection topology and atomic properties. An experimental
	screen comprised nearly 2 million hypothetical oGPCR-ligand complexes,
	from which it was observed that the top 1.96\% predicted affinity
	scores corresponded to "highly active" ligands against orphan receptors.
	Results representing predicted high-scoring novel ligands for many
	oGPCRs are presented here. Validation of the method was carried out
	in several ways: (1) A random permutation of the structure-activity
	relationship of the training data was carried out; by comparing test
	statistic values of the randomized and nonshuffled data, we conclude
	that the value obtained with nonshuffled data is unlikely to have
	been encountered by chance. (2) Biological activities linked to the
	compounds with high cross-target binding affinity were analyzed using
	computed log-odds from a structure-based program. This information
	was correlated with literature citations where GPCR-related pathways
	or processes were linked to the bioactivity in question. (3) Anecdotal,
	out-of-sample predictions for nicotinic targets and known ligands
	were performed, with good accuracy in the low-to-high "active" binding
	range. (4) An out-of-sample consistency check using the commercial
	antipsychotic drug olanzapine produced "active" to "highly-active"
	predicted affinities for all oGPCRs in our study, an observation
	that is consistent with documented findings of cross-target affinity
	of this compound for many different GPCRs. It is suggested that this
	virtual screening approach may be used in support of the functional
	characterization of oGPCRs by identifying potential cognate ligands.
	Ultimately, this approach may have implications for pharmaceutical
	therapies to modulate the activity of faulty or disease-related cellular
	signaling pathways. In addition to application to cell surface receptors,
	this approach is a generalized strategy for discovery of small molecules
	that may bind intracellular enzymes and involve protein-protein interactions.},

	this paper, a previously described data mining approach to prediction

	in genetically-similar organisms. {R}esults: {T}he interaction mining
	approach was demonstrated by building a learning system based on
	1,039 experimentally validated protein-protein interactions in the
	human gastric bacterium {H}elicobacter pylori. {A}n estimate of the

  abstract = {Topological fuzzy pharmacophore triplets (2D-FPT), using the number
	of interposed bonds to measure separation between the atoms representing
	pharmacophore types, were employed to establish and validate quantitative
	structure-activity relationships (QSAR). Thirteen data sets for which
	state-of-the-art QSAR models were reported in literature were revisited
	in order to benchmark 2D-FPT biological activity-explaining propensities.
	Linear and nonlinear QSAR models were constructed for each compound
	series (following the original author's splitting into training/validation
	subsets) with three different 2D-FPT versions, using the genetic
	algorithm-driven Stochastic QSAR sampler (SQS) to pick relevant triplets
	and fit their coefficients. 2D-FPT QSARs are computationally cheap,
	interpretable, and perform well in benchmarking. In a majority of
	cases (10/13), default 2D-FPT models validated better than or as
	well as the best among those reported, including 3D overlay-dependent
	approaches. Most of the analogues series, either unaffected by protonation
	equilibria or unambiguously adopting expected protonation states,
	were equally well described by rule- or pKa-based pharmacophore flagging.
	Thermolysin inhibitors represent a notable exception: pKa-based flagging
	boosts model quality, although--surprisingly--not due to proteolytic
	equilibrium effects. The optimal degree of 2D-FPT fuzziness is compound
	set dependent. This work further confirmed the higher robustness
	of nonlinear over linear SQS models. In spite of the wealth of studied
	sets, benchmarking is nevertheless flawed by low intraset diversity:
	a whole series of thereby caused artifacts were evidenced, implicitly
	raising questions about the way QSAR studies are conducted nowadays.
	An in-depth investigation of thrombin inhibition models revealed
	that some of the selected triplets make sense (one of these stands
	for a topological pharmacophore covering the P1 and P2 binding pockets).
	Nevertheless, equations were either unable to predict the activity
	of the structurally different ligands or tended to indiscriminately
	predict any compound outside the training family to be active. 2D-FPT
	QSARs do however not depend on any common scaffold required for molecule
	superimposition and may in principle be trained on hand of diverse
	sets, which is a must in order to obtain widely applicable models.
	Adding (assumed) inactives of various families for training enabled
	discovery of models that specifically recognize the structurally
	different actives.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces a novel molecular description--topological (2D)
	fuzzy pharmacophore triplets, 2D-FPT--using the number of interposed
	bonds as the measure of separation between the atoms representing
	pharmacophore types (hydrophobic, aromatic, hydrogen-bond donor and
	acceptor, cation, and anion). 2D-FPT features three key improvements
	with respect to the state-of-the-art pharmacophore fingerprints:
	(1) The first key novelty is fuzzy mapping of molecular triplets
	onto the basis set of pharmacophore triplets: unlike in the binary
	scheme where an atom triplet is set to highlight the bit of a single,
	best-matching basis triplet, the herein-defined fuzzy approach allows
	for gradual mapping of each atom triplet onto several related basis
	triplets, thus minimizing binary classification artifacts. (2) The
	second innovation is proteolytic equilibrium dependence, by explicitly
	considering all of the conjugated acids and bases (microspecies).
	2D-FPTs are concentration-weighted (as predicted at pH=7.4) averages
	of microspecies fingerprints. Therefore, small structural modifications,
	not affecting the overall pharmacophore pattern (in the sense of
	classical rule-based assignment), but nevertheless triggering a pKa
	shift, will have a major impact on 2D-FPT. Pairs of almost identical
	compounds with significantly differing activities ("activity cliffs"
	in classical descriptor spaces) were in many cases predictable by
	2D-FPT. (3) The third innovation is a new similarity scoring formula,
	acknowledging that the simultaneous absence of a triplet in two molecules
	is a less-constraining indicator of similarity than its simultaneous
	presence. It displays excellent neighborhood behavior, outperforming
	2D or 3D two-point pharmacophore descriptors or chemical fingerprints.
	The 2D-FPT calculator was developed using the chemoinformatics toolkit

	are no worse than those made using in vitro tests, with the decisive
	advantage that much less investment in technology, resources and

	to screen virtual compounds. Some packages are able to handle thousands

	a lack of confidence in these approaches. An effort should be made
	by the software producers towards more transparency, in order to
	improve the confidence of their consumers. It seems highly probable
	that in silico approaches will evolve rapidly, as did in vitro methods
	during the last decade. Past experience with the latter should be
	helpful in avoiding repetition of similar errors and in taking the
	necessary steps to ensure effective implementation. A general concern
	is the lack of access to the large amounts of data on compounds no

	industry. Controlled access to these data could be particularly helpful

	generating bioactive conformations. Thirty-six drug-like ligands
	from different ligand-protein complexes determined by high-resolution

	significant models (Q(2)> or =0.75) confirm that one can increase

	the results largely because certain bond angles can prevent the bioactive
	conformation from being generated as a low-energy conformation. Pre-optimizing
	the input structures with MMFF94s improved the results significantly.

	{T}omograph ({HRT}; {H}eidelberg {E}ngineering, {H}eidelberg, {G}ermany).
	{METHODS}: {W}ith the {HRT}, one eye was imaged from each of 108
	patients with glaucoma (defined as having repeatable visual field
	defects with standard automated perimetry) and 189 subjects without
	glaucoma (no visual field defects with healthy-appearing optic disc
	and retinal nerve fiber layer on clinical examination) and the optic
	nerve topography was defined by 17 global and 66 regional {HRT} parameters.
	{W}ith all the {HRT} parameters used as input, receiver operating
	characteristic ({ROC}) curves were generated for the classification
	of eyes, by three neural network techniques: linear and {G}aussian
	support vector machines ({SVM} linear and {SVM} {G}aussian, respectively)
	and a multilayer perceptron ({MLP}), as well as four previously proposed

	{T}he areas under the {ROC} curves for {SVM} linear and {SVM} {G}aussian
	were 0.938 and 0.945, respectively; for {MLP}, 0.941; for the current

	and provide accurate classification of glaucomatous and healthy eyes.
	{RVM} may be preferable to {SVM}, because it provides a {B}ayesian-derived

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are no recent estimates of the incidence and mortality
	from cancer at a European level. Those data that are available generally
	refer to the mid-1990s and are of limited use for cancer control
	planning. We present estimates of the cancer burden in Europe in
	2004, including data for the (25 Member States) European Union. METHODS:
	The most recent sources of incidence and mortality data available
	in the Descriptive Epidemiology Group at IARC were applied to population
	projections to derive the best estimates of the burden of cancer,
	in terms of incidence and mortality, for Europe in 2004. RESULTS:
	In 2004 in Europe, there were an estimated 2,886,800 incident cases
	of cancer diagnosed and 1,711,000 cancer deaths. The most common
	incident form of cancer was lung cancer (13.3\% of all incident cases),
	followed by colorectal cancer (13.2\%) and breast cancer (13\%).
	Lung cancer was also the most common cause of cancer death (341,800
	deaths), followed by colorectal (203,700), stomach (137,900) and
	breast (129,900). CONCLUSIONS: With an estimated 2.9 million new
	cases (54\% occurring in men, 46\% in women) and 1.7 million deaths
	(56\% in men, 44\% in women) each year, cancer remains an important
	public health problem in Europe, and the ageing of the European population
	will cause these numbers to continue to increase even if age-specific
	rates remain constant. To make great progress quickly against cancer
	in Europe, the need is evident to make a concerted attack on the
	big killers: lung, colorectal, breast and stomach cancer. Stomach
	cancer rates are falling everywhere in Europe and public health measures
	are available to reduce the incidence and mortality of lung cancer,
	colorectal cancer and breast cancer.},

	of these genes will provide the foundation for future drug and vaccine

	the complete asexual intraerythrocytic developmental cycle ({IDC})
	transcriptome of the {HB}3 strain of {P}. falciparum, we demonstrate
	that at least 60{percnt} of the genome is transcriptionally active
	during this stage. {O}ur data demonstrate that this parasite has
	evolved an extremely specialized mode of transcriptional regulation
	that produces a continuous cascade of gene expression, beginning
	with genes corresponding to general cellular processes, such as protein
	synthesis, and ending with {P}lasmodium-specific functionalities,
	such as genes involved in erythrocyte invasion. {T}he data reveal
	that genes contiguous along the chromosomes are rarely coregulated,

	protein structures with unknown function, therefore, accurate, automated
	predictors of protein function are required if all these structures
	are to be properly annotated in reasonable time. {I}dentifying the
	interface between two interacting proteins provides important clues
	to the function of a protein and can reduce the search space required
	by docking algorithms to predict the structures of complexes. {RESULTS}:
	{W}e have combined a support vector machine ({SVM}) approach with
	surface patch analysis to predict protein-protein binding sites.
	{U}sing a leave-one-out cross-validation procedure, we were able
	to successfully predict the location of the binding site on 76\%
	of our dataset made up of proteins with both transient and obligate
	interfaces. {W}ith heterogeneous cross-validation, where we trained
	the {SVM} on transient complexes to predict on obligate complexes
	(and vice versa), we still achieved comparable success rates to the
	leave-one-out cross-validation suggesting that sufficient properties
	are shared between transient and obligate interfaces. {AVAILABILITY}:

  abstract = {O{BJECTIVE}:: {I}t has been reported in medical literature that health
	care professionals have difficulty distinguishing a newborn's facial
	expressions of pain from facial reactions to other stimuli. {A}lthough
	a number of pain instruments have been developed to assist health
	professionals, studies demonstrate that health professionals are
	not entirely impartial in their assessment of pain and fail to capitalize
	on all the information exhibited in a newborn's facial displays.
	{T}his study tackles these problems by applying three different state-of-the-art
	face classification techniques to the task of distinguishing a newborn's
	facial expressions of pain. {METHODS}:: {T}he facial expressions
	of 26 neonates between the ages of 18h and 3 days old were photographed
	experiencing the pain of a heel lance and a variety of stressors,
	including transport from one crib to another (a disturbance that
	can provoke crying that is not in response to pain), an air stimulus
	on the nose, and friction on the external lateral surface of the
	heel. {T}hree face classification techniques, principal component
	analysis ({PCA}), linear discriminant analysis ({LDA}), and support
	vector machine ({SVM}), were used to classify the faces. {RESULTS}::
	{I}n our experiments, the best recognition rates of pain versus nonpain
	(88.00\%), pain versus rest (94.62\%), pain versus cry (80.00\%),
	pain versus air puff (83.33\%), and pain versus friction (93.00\%)
	were obtained from an {SVM} with a polynomial kernel of degree 3.
	{T}he {SVM} outperformed two commonly used methods in face classification:
	{PCA} and {LDA}, each using the {L}(1) distance metric. {CONCLUSION}::
	{T}he results of this study indicate that the application of face
	classification techniques in pain assessment and management is a
	promising area of investigation.},

	details of this interaction are of importance in the design of peptide
	vaccines. Algorithms based on primary sequence have had success in
	predicting potential antigenic peptides for MHCI, but such algorithms
	have limited accuracy and provide no structural information. Here,
	we present an algorithm, PePSSI (peptide-MHC prediction of structure
	through solvated interfaces), for the prediction of peptide structure
	when bound to the MHCI molecule, HLA-A2. The algorithm combines sampling
	of peptide backbone conformations and flexible movement of MHC side
	chains and is unique among other prediction algorithms in its incorporation
	of explicit water molecules at the peptide-MHC interface. In an initial
	test of the algorithm, PePSSI was used to predict the conformation
	of eight peptides bound to HLA-A2, for which X-ray data are available.
	Comparison of the predicted and X-ray conformations of these peptides
	gave RMSD values between 1.301 and 2.475 A. Binding conformations
	of 266 peptides with known binding affinities for HLA-A2 were then
	predicted using PePSSI. Structural analyses of these peptide-HLA-A2
	conformations showed that peptide binding affinity is positively
	correlated with the number of peptide-MHC contacts and negatively
	correlated with the number of interfacial water molecules. These
	results are consistent with the relatively hydrophobic binding nature
	of the HLA-A2 peptide binding interface. In summary, PePSSI is capable
	of rapid and accurate prediction of peptide-MHC binding conformations,
	which may in turn allow estimation of MHCI-peptide binding affinity.},

	(MHC) molecules is commonly used to assist in the identification
	of T cell epitopes. However, because of the large numbers of different
	MHC molecules of interest, each associated with different predictive
	tools, tool generation and evaluation can be a very resource intensive
	task. A methodology commonly used to predict MHC binding affinity
	is the matrix or linear coefficients method. Herein, we described
	Average Relative Binding (ARB) matrix methods that directly predict
	IC(50) values allowing combination of searches involving different
	peptide sizes and alleles into a single global prediction. A computer
	program was developed to automate the generation and evaluation of
	ARB predictive tools. Using an in-house MHC binding database, we
	generated a total of 85 and 13 MHC class I and class II matrices,
	respectively. Results from the automated evaluation of tool efficiency
	are presented. We anticipate that this automation framework will
	be generally applicable to the generation and evaluation of large
	numbers of MHC predictive methods and tools, and will be of value
	to centralize and rationalize the process of evaluation of MHC predictions.

	{W}e used a variety of machine learning methods to automatically

	{RESULTS}: {W}e demonstrate that machine learning approaches using

	value in patients with node-negative breast cancer. Our goal was
	to validate the signature in an independent group of patients. METHODS:
	Patients (n = 307, with 137 events after a median follow-up of 13.6
	years) from five European centers were divided into high- and low-risk
	groups based on the gene signature classification and on clinical
	risk classifications. Patients were assigned to the gene signature
	low-risk group if their 5-year distant metastasis-free survival probability
	as estimated by the gene signature was greater than 90\%. Patients
	were assigned to the clinicopathologic low-risk group if their 10-year
	survival probability, as estimated by Adjuvant! software, was greater
	than 88\% (for estrogen receptor [ER]-positive patients) or 92\%
	(for ER-negative patients). Hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated to
	compare time to distant metastases, disease-free survival, and overall
	survival in high- versus low-risk groups. RESULTS: The 70-gene signature
	outperformed the clinicopathologic risk assessment in predicting
	all endpoints. For time to distant metastases, the gene signature
	yielded HR = 2.32 (95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.35 to 4.00)
	without adjustment for clinical risk and hazard ratios ranging from
	2.13 to 2.15 after adjustment for various estimates of clinical risk;
	clinicopathologic risk using Adjuvant! software yielded an unadjusted
	HR = 1.68 (95\% CI = 0.92 to 3.07). For overall survival, the gene
	signature yielded an unadjusted HR = 2.79 (95\% CI = 1.60 to 4.87)
	and adjusted hazard ratios ranging from 2.63 to 2.89; clinicopathologic
	risk yielded an unadjusted HR = 1.67 (95\% CI = 0.93 to 2.98). For
	patients in the gene signature high-risk group, 10-year overall survival
	was 0.69 for patients in both the low- and high-clinical risk groups;
	for patients in the gene signature low-risk group, the 10-year survival
	rates were 0.88 and 0.89, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The 70-gene
	signature adds independent prognostic information to clinicopathologic
	risk assessment for patients with early breast cancer.},

	integrating biological properties into the model. It then becomes
	possible to analyze, query, verify and maintain the model with respect
	to those properties. For kinetic models, BIOCHAM can search for appropriate
	parameter values in order to reproduce a specific behavior observed
	in experiments and formalized in temporal logic. Coupled with other
	methods such as bifurcation diagrams, this search assists the modeler/biologist

  abstract = {Human cancers often carry many somatically acquired genomic rearrangements,
	some of which may be implicated in cancer development. However, conventional
	strategies for characterizing rearrangements are laborious and low-throughput
	and have low sensitivity or poor resolution. We used massively parallel
	sequencing to generate sequence reads from both ends of short DNA
	fragments derived from the genomes of two individuals with lung cancer.
	By investigating read pairs that did not align correctly with respect
	to each other on the reference human genome, we characterized 306
	germline structural variants and 103 somatic rearrangements to the
	base-pair level of resolution. The patterns of germline and somatic
	rearrangement were markedly different. Many somatic rearrangements
	were from amplicons, although rearrangements outside these regions,
	notably including tandem duplications, were also observed. Some somatic
	rearrangements led to abnormal transcripts, including two from internal
	tandem duplications and two fusion transcripts created by interchromosomal
	rearrangements. Germline variants were predominantly mediated by
	retrotransposition, often involving AluY and LINE elements. The results
	demonstrate the feasibility of systematic, genome-wide characterization
	of rearrangements in complex human cancer genomes, raising the prospect
	of a new harvest of genes associated with cancer using this strategy.},

	({SVM}s) for prediction and analysis of antisense oligonucleotide

	including 68 features each, inducing a problem well-suited to {SVM}s.
	{T}he task of feature selection is crucial given the presence of
	noisy or redundant features, and the well-known problem of the curse
	of dimensionality. {W}e propose a two-stage strategy to develop an
	optimal model: (1) feature selection using correlation analysis,
	mutual information, and {SVM}-based recursive feature elimination
	({SVM}-{RFE}), and (2) {AO} prediction using standard and profiled
	{SVM} formulations. {A} profiled {SVM} gives different weights to
	different parts of the training data to focus the training on the
	most important regions. {R}esults {I}n the first stage, the {SVM}-{RFE}
	technique was most efficient and robust in the presence of low number
	of samples and high input space dimension. {T}his method yielded
	an optimal subset of 14 representative features, which were all related
	to energy and sequence motifs. {T}he second stage evaluated the performance
	of the predictors (overall correlation coefficient between observed
	and predicted efficacy, r; mean error, {ME}; and root-mean-square-error,
	{RMSE}) using 8-fold and minus-one-{RNA} cross-validation methods.
	{T}he profiled {SVM} produced the best results (r = 0.44, {ME} =
	0.022, and {RMSE}= 0.278) and predicted high (>75% inhibition of
	gene expression) and low efficacy (<25%) {AO}s with a success rate
	of 83.3% and 82.9%, respectively, which is better than by previous
	approaches. {A} web server for {AO} prediction is available online
	at http://aosvm.cgb.ki.se/. {C}onclusions {T}he {SVM} approach is
	well suited to the {AO} prediction problem, and yields a prediction
	accuracy superior to previous methods. {T}he profiled {SVM} was found
	to perform better than the standard {SVM}, suggesting that it could
	lead to improvements in other prediction problems as well.},

	automatic prediction of protein stability changes upon single point
	mutations. {I}-{M}utant2.0 predictions are performed starting either
	from the protein structure or, more importantly, from the protein
	sequence. {T}his latter task, to the best of our knowledge, is exploited
	for the first time. {T}he method was trained and tested on a data
	set derived from {P}ro{T}herm, which is presently the most comprehensive
	available database of thermodynamic experimental data of free energy
	changes of protein stability upon mutation under different conditions.
	{I}-{M}utant2.0 can be used both as a classifier for predicting the
	sign of the protein stability change upon mutation and as a regression
	estimator for predicting the related {D}elta{D}elta{G} values. {A}cting
	as a classifier, {I}-{M}utant2.0 correctly predicts (with a cross-validation
	procedure) 80\% or 77\% of the data set, depending on the usage of
	structural or sequence information, respectively. {W}hen predicting
	{D}elta{D}elta{G} values associated with mutations, the correlation
	of predicted with expected/experimental values is 0.71 (with a standard
	error of 1.30 kcal/mol) and 0.62 (with a standard error of 1.45 kcal/mol)
	when structural or sequence information are respectively adopted.
	{O}ur web interface allows the selection of a predictive mode that
	depends on the availability of the protein structure and/or sequence.
	{I}n this latter case, the web server requires only pasting of a

	mechanics (ICM) program can accurately identify the ligand-binding
	pocket in the currently available crystal structures of seven transmembrane
	(7TM) proteins [bacteriorhodopsin (BR) and bovine rhodopsin (bRho)].
	The binding geometry of the ligand can be accurately predicted by
	ICM flexible docking with and without the loop regions, a useful
	finding for GPCR docking because the transmembrane regions are easier
	to model. We also demonstrate that the native ligand can be identified
	by flexible docking and scoring in 1.5\% and 0.2\% (for bRho and
	BR, respectively) of the best scoring compounds from two different
	types of compound database. The same procedure can be applied to
	the database of available chemicals to identify specific GPCR binders.
	Finally, we demonstrate that even if the sidechain positions in the
	bRho binding pocket are entirely wrong, their correct conformation
	can be fully restored with high accuracy (0.28 A) through the ICM
	global optimization with and without the ligand present. These binding
	site adjustments are critical for flexible docking of new ligands

	docking method has the potential to be used to "de-orphanize" orphan

	of 250); the sensitivity, 95.45\% (105 of 110); the specificity,
	77.86\% (109 of 140); the positive predictive value, 77.21\% (105
	of 136); and the negative predictive value, 95.61\% (109 of 114).
	{CONCLUSION}: {T}he {SVM} proved helpful in the imaging diagnosis
	of breast cancer. {T}he classification ability of the {SVM} is nearly
	equal to that of the neural network model, and the {SVM} has a much
	shorter training time (1 vs 189 seconds). {G}iven the increasing
	size and complexity of data sets, the {SVM} is therefore preferable
	for computer-aided diagnosis.},

	We focused on dynamic properties of the mitochondrial apoptosis regulatory

	process of Bax-activation is indicated. Further analysis suggests
	that the core module of Bax-activation is bistable in both deterministic

	ranges of parameter variation. When coupling with Bax-polymerization,
	it forms a one-way-switch, which governs irreversible behaviors of
	Bax-activation even with attenuation of apoptotic stimulus. Together

	made cannabinoid (CB) receptors one of the most important G-protein-coupled

	lack of related 3D experimental structures, we have established a
	structure-based virtual screening protocol to search for CB2 bioactive
	antagonists based on the 3D CB2 homology structure model. However,
	the existing homology-predicted 3D models often deviate from the
	native structure and therefore may incorrectly bias the in silico

	database query algorithm to examine the constructed 3D CB2 receptor
	structure model as well as the predicted binding pocket. In the present
	study, an antagonist-bound CB2 receptor complex model was initially
	generated using flexible docking simulation and then further optimized
	by molecular dynamic and mechanical (MD/MM) calculations. The refined
	3D structural model of the CB2-ligand complex was then inspected
	by exploring the interactions between the receptor and ligands in
	order to predict the potential CB2 binding pocket for its antagonist.
	The ligand-receptor complex model and the predicted antagonist binding
	pockets were further processed and validated by FlexX-Pharm docking
	against a testing compound database that contains known antagonists.
	Furthermore, a consensus scoring (CScore) function algorithm was
	established to rank the binding interaction modes of a ligand on
	the CB2 receptor. Our results indicated that the known antagonists
	seeded in the testing database can be distinguished from a significant

	originating from the irregular Brownian motion, can be applied in
	modeling the transcriptional regulatory network in Saccharomyces

	Our goal is to fit a generalized linear model by combining putative
	regulators to estimate the transcriptional pattern of a target gene.
	Goodness-of-fit is evaluated by log-likelihood and Akaike Information
	Criterion. Moreover, estimations of the contribution of regulators
	and inference of transcriptional pattern are implemented by statistical
	approaches. Our SDE model is basic but the test results agree well

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Reproducibility analyses of biologically relevant microarray
	studies have mostly focused on overlap of detected biomarkers or
	correlation of differential expression evidences across studies.
	For clinical utility, direct inter-study prediction (i.e. to establish
	a prediction model in one study and apply to another) for disease
	diagnosis or prognosis prediction is more important. Normalization
	plays a key role for such a task. Traditionally, sample-wise normalization
	has been a standard for inter-array and inter-study normalization.
	For gene-wise normalization, it has been implemented for intra-study
	or inter-study predictions in a few papers while its rationale, strategy
	and effect remain unexplored. RESULTS: In this article, we investigate
	the effect of gene-wise normalization in microarray inter-study prediction.
	Gene-specific intensity discrepancies across studies are commonly
	found even after proper sample-wise normalization. We explore the
	rationale and necessity of gene-wise normalization. We also show
	that the ratio of sample sizes in normal versus diseased groups can
	greatly affect the performance of gene-wise normalization and an
	analytical method is developed to adjust for the imbalanced ratio
	effect. Both simulation results and applications to three lung cancer
	and two prostate cancer data sets, considering both binary classification
	and survival risk predictions, showed significant and robust improvement
	of the new adjustment. A calibration scheme is developed to apply
	the ratio-adjusted gene-wise normalization for prospective clinical
	trials. The number of calibration samples needed is estimated from
	existing studies and suggested for future applications. The result
	has important implication to the translational research of microarray
	as a practical disease diagnosis and prognosis prediction tool.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The characterization of copy number alteration patterns
	in breast cancer requires high-resolution genome-wide profiling of
	a large panel of tumor specimens. To date, most genome-wide array
	comparative genomic hybridization studies have used tumor panels
	of relatively large tumor size and high Nottingham Prognostic Index
	(NPI) that are not as representative of breast cancer demographics.
	RESULTS: We performed an oligo-array-based high-resolution analysis
	of copy number alterations in 171 primary breast tumors of relatively
	small size and low NPI, which was therefore more representative of
	breast cancer demographics. Hierarchical clustering over the common
	regions of alteration identified a novel subtype of high-grade estrogen
	receptor (ER)-negative breast cancer, characterized by a low genomic
	instability index. We were able to validate the existence of this
	genomic subtype in one external breast cancer cohort. Using matched
	array expression data we also identified the genomic regions showing
	the strongest coordinate expression changes ('hotspots'). We show
	that several of these hotspots are located in the phosphatome, kinome
	and chromatinome, and harbor members of the 122-breast cancer CAN-list.
	Furthermore, we identify frequently amplified hotspots on 8q22.3
	(EDD1, WDSOF1), 8q24.11-13 (THRAP6, DCC1, SQLE, SPG8) and 11q14.1
	(NDUFC2, ALG8, USP35) associated with significantly worse prognosis.
	Amplification of any of these regions identified 37 samples with
	significantly worse overall survival (hazard ratio (HR) = 2.3 (1.3-1.4)
	p = 0.003) and time to distant metastasis (HR = 2.6 (1.4-5.1) p =
	0.004) independently of NPI. CONCLUSION: We present strong evidence
	for the existence of a novel subtype of high-grade ER-negative tumors
	that is characterized by a low genomic instability index. We also
	provide a genome-wide list of common copy number alteration regions
	in breast cancer that show strong coordinate aberrant expression,
	and further identify novel frequently amplified regions that correlate
	with poor prognosis. Many of the genes associated with these regions
	represent likely novel oncogenes or tumor suppressors.},

	activated caspase-3 quickly executes apoptosis, but it takes considerable

	we have found that XIAP in the feedback loops primarily regulates
	induction time of caspase-3. In many cancer cells activation of caspase-3

  abstract = {Transcription profiling experiments permit the expression levels of
	many genes to be measured simultaneously. {G}iven profiling data
	from two types of samples, genes that most distinguish the samples
	(marker genes) are good candidates for subsequent in-depth experimental
	studies and developing decision support systems for diagnosis, prognosis,
	and monitoring. {T}his work proposes a mixture of feature relevance
	experts as a method for identifying marker genes and illustrates
	the idea using published data from samples labeled as acute lymphoblastic
	and myeloid leukemia ({ALL}, {AML}). {A} feature relevance expert
	implements an algorithm that calculates how well a gene distinguishes
	samples, reorders genes according to this relevance measure, and
	uses a supervised learning method [here, support vector machines
	({SVM}s)] to determine the generalization performances of different
	nested gene subsets. {T}he mixture of three feature relevance experts
	examined implement two existing and one novel feature relevance measures.
	{F}or each expert, a gene subset consisting of the top 50 genes distinguished
	{ALL} from {AML} samples as completely as all 7,070 genes. {T}he
	125 genes at the union of the top 50s are plausible markers for a
	prototype decision support system. {C}hromosomal aberration and other
	data support the prediction that the three genes at the intersection
	of the top 50s, cystatin {C}, azurocidin, and adipsin, are good targets
	for investigating the basic biology of {ALL}/{AML}. {T}he same data
	were employed to identify markers that distinguish samples based
	on their labels of {T} cell/{B} cell, peripheral blood/bone marrow,
	and male/female. {S}elenoprotein {W} may discriminate {T} cells from
	{B} cells. {R}esults from analysis of transcription profiling data
	from tumor/nontumor colon adenocarcinoma samples support the general
	utility of the aforementioned approach. {T}heoretical issues such
	as choosing {SVM} kernels and their parameters, training and evaluating
	feature relevance experts, and the impact of potentially mislabeled
	samples on marker identification (feature selection) are discussed.},

	Here, we apply a protein-network-based approach that identifies markers

	for pathways involved in tumor progression. Although genes with known
	breast cancer mutations are typically not detected through analysis

	network by interconnecting many differentially expressed genes. We
	find that the subnetwork markers are more reproducible than individual

  abstract = {Breast cancer is the most common malignancy among American women.
	Due to increased screening, the majority of patients present with
	early-stage breast cancer. The Oxford Overview Analysis demonstrates
	that adjuvant hormonal therapy and polychemotherapy reduce the risk
	of recurrence and death from breast cancer. Adjuvant systemic therapy,
	however, has associated risks and it would be useful to be able to
	optimally select patients most likely to benefit. The purpose of
	adjuvant systemic therapy is to eradicate distant micrometastatic
	deposits. It is essential therefore to be able to estimate an individual
	patient's risk of harboring clinically silent micrometastatic disease
	using established prognostic factors. It is also beneficial to be
	able to select the optimal adjuvant therapy for an individual patient
	based on established predictive factors. It is standard practice
	to administer systemic therapy to all patients with lymph node-positive
	disease. However, there are clearly differences among node-positive
	women that may warrant a more aggressive therapeutic approach. Furthermore,
	there are many node-negative women who would also benefit from adjuvant
	systemic therapy. Prognostic factors therefore must be differentiated
	from predictive factors. A prognostic factor is any measurement available
	at the time of surgery that correlates with disease-free or overall
	survival in the absence of systemic adjuvant therapy and, as a result,
	is able to correlate with the natural history of the disease. In
	contrast, a predictive factor is any measurement associated with
	response to a given therapy. Some factors, such as hormone receptors
	and HER2/neu overexpression, are both prognostic and predictive.},

	Theoretical studies suggest that oscillations can arise from a combination
	of positive and negative feedbacks or from a long negative feedback
	loop alone. Both negative and positive feedbacks are present in the
	p53/Mdm2 network, but it is not known what roles they play in the
	oscillatory response to DNA damage. We developed a mathematical model
	of p53 oscillations based on positive and negative feedbacks in the
	p53/Mdm2 network. According to the model, the system reacts to DNA
	damage by moving from a stable steady state into a region of stable
	limit cycles. Oscillations in the model are born with large amplitude,
	which guarantees an all-or-none response to damage. As p53 oscillates,
	damage is repaired and the system moves back to a stable steady state
	with low p53 activity. The model reproduces experimental data in
	quantitative detail. We suggest new experiments for dissecting the
	contributions of negative and positive feedbacks to the generation

	of the al-1 gene showed that a transgene must contain at least approximately
	132 bp of sequences homologous to the transcribed region of the native

	promoter sequences do not cause quelling. Specific sequences are
	not required for gene silencing, as different regions of the al-1
	gene produced quelling. A mutant defective in cytosine methylation
	(dim-2) exhibited normal frequencies and degrees of silencing, indicating
	that cytosine methylation is not responsible for quelling, despite
	the fact that methylation of transgene sequences frequently is correlated
	with silencing. Silencing was shown to be a dominant trait, operative
	in heterokaryotic strains containing a mixture of transgenic and
	non-transgenic nuclei. This result indicates that a diffusable, trans-acting
	molecule is involved in quelling. A transgene-derived, sense RNA
	was detected in quelled strains and was found to be absent in their

  abstract = {P{URPOSE}: {P}rimary malignant melanoma of the choroid and ciliary
	body has traditionally been treated without histologic staging, using
	purely clinical indicators. {T}he presence of extravascular matrix
	patterns ({EMP}) in histologic sections of uveal melanoma has been
	shown to be an independent indicator of metastatic risk. {T}hese
	patterns are of a dimension and physical composition that are likely
	to be detected with ultrasound backscatter analysis. {O}ur aim was
	to determine whether ultrasound parameter imaging could detect the
	presence of {EMP} at a diagnostically significant level for treatment
	staging and for planning investigational studies of therapeutic modalities.
	{DESIGN}: {P}rospective, masked ultrasound-pathologic correlative
	study. {PARTICIPANTS}: {O}ne hundred seventeen patients diagnosed
	with previously untreated choroidal melanoma were scanned within
	2 weeks before enucleation. {METHODS}: {T}umors were evaluated histologically
	and divided into high-risk and low-risk groups on the basis of the
	presence of 2\% or more histologic cross-sectional area composed
	of {EMP} patterns. {D}igital ultrasound data were processed to generate
	parameter images representing the size and concentration of ultrasound
	scatterers. {H}istologic and ultrasound images and data were correlated,
	and linear and nonlinear statistical methods were used to create
	multivariate models for noninvasive differentiation of high-risk
	and low-risk tumors. {MAIN} {OUTCOME} {MEASURES}: {P}resence or absence
	of high-risk {EMP} and associated ultrasound parameter classification
	models. {RESULTS}: {O}f the 117 tumors, 69 were classified as low
	risk, and 48 were classified as high-risk with histologic analysis.
	{A} classification that used ultrasound parameter image features
	with linear discriminant analysis could correctly identify 79.5\%
	of cases retrospectively and 75.2\% of cases by use of cross-validation,
	an estimate of prospective classification ability. {B}y use of a
	more powerful classification technique (support vector machine),
	93.1\% of cases were correctly classified retrospectively. {W}ith
	a cross-validation procedure, 80.10\% of cases were correctly classified.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {U}ltrasound can be used noninvasively to classify
	tumors into high-risk and low-risk groups by detecting the presence
	of {EMP} patterns. {B}y the use of previous studies that compared
	the histologic presence of {EMP} patterns with patient survival,
	estimates of hazard rates associated with ultrasound risk groups
	can be made. {T}he noninvasive ultrasound classification is potentially
	useful as a prognostic variable and as a tool for stratification

  year = {2007},
  volume = {8},
  pages = {80},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: With the growing abundance of microarray data, statistical
	methods are increasingly needed to integrate results across studies.
	Two common approaches for meta-analysis of microarrays include either
	combining gene expression measures across studies or combining summaries
	such as p-values, probabilities or ranks. Here, we compare two Bayesian
	meta-analysis models that are analogous to these methods. RESULTS:
	Two Bayesian meta-analysis models for microarray data have recently
	been introduced. The first model combines standardized gene expression
	measures across studies into an overall mean, accounting for inter-study
	variability, while the second combines probabilities of differential
	expression without combining expression values. Both models produce
	the gene-specific posterior probability of differential expression,
	which is the basis for inference. Since the standardized expression
	integration model includes inter-study variability, it may improve
	accuracy of results versus the probability integration model. However,
	due to the small number of studies typical in microarray meta-analyses,
	the variability between studies is challenging to estimate. The probability
	integration model eliminates the need to model variability between
	studies, and thus its implementation is more straightforward. We
	found in simulations of two and five studies that combining probabilities
	outperformed combining standardized gene expression measures for
	three comparison values: the percent of true discovered genes in
	meta-analysis versus individual studies; the percent of true genes
	omitted in meta-analysis versus separate studies, and the number
	of true discovered genes for fixed levels of Bayesian false discovery.
	We identified similar results when pooling two independent studies
	of Bacillus subtilis. We assumed that each study was produced from
	the same microarray platform with only two conditions: a treatment
	and control, and that the data sets were pre-scaled. CONCLUSION:
	The Bayesian meta-analysis model that combines probabilities across
	studies does not aggregate gene expression measures, thus an inter-study
	variability parameter is not included in the model. This results
	in a simpler modeling approach than aggregating expression measures,
	which accounts for variability across studies. The probability integration
	model identified more true discovered genes and fewer true omitted
	genes than combining expression measures, for our data sets.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Biologists often conduct multiple but different cDNA microarray
	studies that all target the same biological system or pathway. Within
	each study, replicate slides within repeated identical experiments
	are often produced. Pooling information across studies can help more
	accurately identify true target genes. Here, we introduce a method
	to integrate multiple independent studies efficiently. RESULTS: We
	introduce a Bayesian hierarchical model to pool cDNA microarray data
	across multiple independent studies to identify highly expressed
	genes. Each study has multiple sources of variation, i.e. replicate
	slides within repeated identical experiments. Our model produces
	the gene-specific posterior probability of differential expression,
	which provides a direct method for ranking genes, and provides Bayesian
	estimates of false discovery rates (FDR). In simulations combining
	two and five independent studies, with fixed FDR levels, we observed
	large increases in the number of discovered genes in pooled versus
	individual analyses. When the number of output genes is fixed (e.g.,
	top 100), the pooled model found appreciably more truly differentially
	expressed genes than the individual studies. We were also able to
	identify more differentially expressed genes from pooling two independent
	studies in Bacillus subtilis than from each individual data set.
	Finally, we observed that in our simulation studies our Bayesian
	FDR estimates tracked the true FDRs very well. CONCLUSION: Our method
	provides a cohesive framework for combining multiple but not identical
	microarray studies with several sources of replication, with data
	produced from the same platform. We assume that each study contains
	only two conditions: an experimental and a control sample. We demonstrated

  abstract = {Structure-based Drug Design (SBDD) is an essential part of the modern
	medicinal chemistry, and has led to the acceleration of many projects,
	and even to drugs on the market. Programs that perform docking and
	scoring of ligands to receptors are powerful tools in the drug designer's
	armoury that enhance the process of SBDD. They are even deployed
	on the desktop of many bench chemists. It is timely to review the
	state of the art, to understand how good our docking programs are,
	and what are the issues. In this review we would like to provide
	a guide around the reliable aspects of docking and scoring and the
	associated pitfalls aiming at an audience of medicinal chemists rather
	than modellers. For convenience, we will divide the review into two
	parts: docking and scoring. Docking concerns the preparation of the
	receptor and the ligand(s), the sampling of conformational space
	and stereochemistry (if appropriate). Scoring concerns the evaluation
	of all of the ligand-receptor poses generated by docking. The two
	processes are not truly independent, and this will be discussed here
	in detail. The preparation of the receptor and ligand(s) before docking
	requires great care. For the receptor, issues of protonation, tautomerisation
	and hydration are key, and we will discuss current approaches to
	these issues. Even more important is the degree of sampling: can
	the algorithms reproduce what is observed experimentally? If they
	can, are the scoring algorithms good enough to recognise this pose
	as the best? Do the scores correlate with observed binding affinity?
	How does local knowledge of the target (for example hinge-binding
	to a kinase) affect the accuracy of the predictions? We will review
	the key findings from several evaluation studies and present conclusions
	about when and how to interpret and trust the results of docking
	and scoring. Finally, we will present an outline of some of the latest
	developments in the area of scoring functions.},

	of human cancer has been facilitated through the development and
	application of a diverse series of high resolution, high throughput
	microarray platforms. Essentially there are two types of array; those
	that carry PCR products from cloned nucleic acids (e.g. cDNA, BACs,
	cosmids) and those that use oligonucleotides. Each has advantages
	and disadvantages but it is now possible to survey genome wide DNA
	copy number abnormalities and expression levels to allow correlations
	between losses, gains and amplifications in tumor cells with genes
	that are over- and under-expressed in the same samples. The gene
	expression arrays that provide estimates of mRNA levels in tumors
	have given rise to exon-specific arrays that can identify both gene
	expression levels, alternative splicing events and mRNA processing
	alterations. Oligonucleotide arrays are also being used to interrogate
	single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) throughout the genome for
	linkage and association studies and these have been adapted to quantify
	copy number abnormalities and loss of heterozygosity events. To identify
	as yet unknown transcripts tiling arrays across the genome have been
	developed which can also identify DNA methylation changes and be
	used to identify DNA-protein interactions using ChIP on Chip protocols.
	Ultimately DNA sequencing arrays will allow resequencing of chromosome
	regions and whole genomes. With all of these capabilities becoming
	routine in genomics laboratories, the idea of a systematic characterization
	of the sum genetic events that give rise to a cancer cell is rapidly
	becoming a reality.},

	were trained using data from voxels in predefined regions of interest

	of subsequently collected f{MRI} data was attempted according to
	the similarity of activation patterns to prior training examples.
	{C}lassification was done using only small amounts of data (20 s
	worth) at a time, so such a technique could, in principle, be used
	to extract information about a subject's percept on a near real-time
	basis. {C}lassifiers trained on data acquired during one session
	were equally accurate in classifying data collected within the same
	session and across sessions separated by more than a week, in the

	obtained using patterns of activity including lower visual areas
	as input, classification accuracies well above chance were achieved
	using regions of interest restricted to higher-order object-selective
	visual areas. {I}n contrast to typical f{MRI} data analysis, in which
	hours of data across many subjects are averaged to reveal slight
	differences in activation, the use of pattern recognition methods
	allows a subtle 10-way discrimination to be performed on an essentially

	for experimental observations. In this paper, we continue to extend
	this model by adding interactions according to updating experimental
	findings. Methodology/Principal Findings - Through mathematical simulation
	we found bistability, a kind of switch, can arise from a positive
	(double negative) feedback in the Bcl-2 interaction network established
	by anti-apoptotic group of Bcl-2 family proteins. Moreover, Bax/Bak
	auto-activation as an independent positive feedback can enforce the
	bistability, and make it more robust to parameter variations. By
	ensemble stochastic modeling, we also elucidated how intrinsic noise
	can change ultrasensitive switches into gradual responses. Our modeling
	result agrees well with recent experimental data where bimodal Bax
	activation distributions in cell population were found. Conclusions/Significance
	- Along with the growing experimental evidences, our studies successfully
	elucidate the switch mechanism embedded in the Bcl-2 interaction
	network and provide insights into pharmacological manipulation of

	the number of new genomes has dramatically increased over recent

	location is urgently needed. {R}esults {E}sub8 was developed to predict
	protein subcellular localizations for eukaryotic proteins based on

	into the following eight groups: chloroplast, cytoplasm, extracellular,

	a different approach for predicting protein subcellular localization

	cancers including ovarian cancer, a leading cause of gynaecologic
	cancer mortality worldwide. METHODS: We examined single nucleotide
	polymorphisms (SNPs) (n=288) from 39 cell cycle regulation genes,
	including cyclins, cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) and CDK inhibitors,
	in a two-stage study. White, non-Hispanic cases (n=829) and ovarian
	cancer-free controls (n=941) were genotyped using an Illumina assay.
	RESULTS: Eleven variants in nine genes (ABL1, CCNB2, CDKN1A, CCND3,
	E2F2, CDK2, E2F3, CDC2, and CDK7) were associated with risk of ovarian
	cancer in at least one genetic model. Seven SNPs were then assessed
	in four additional studies with 1689 cases and 3398 controls. Association
	between risk of ovarian cancer and ABL1 rs2855192 found in the original
	population [odds ratio, OR(BB vs AA) 2.81 (1.29-6.09), P=0.01] was
	also observed in a replication population, and the association remained
	suggestive in the combined analysis [OR(BB vs AA) 1.59 (1.08-2.34),
	P=0.02]. No other SNP associations remained suggestive in the replication
	populations. CONCLUSION: ABL1 has been implicated in multiple processes
	including cell division, cell adhesion and cellular stress response.
	These results suggest that characterization of the function of genetic
	variation in this gene in other ovarian cancer populations is warranted.},

	We previously mapped LQT loci on chromosomes 11 (LQT1), 7 (LQT2),

	putative potassium channel gene, HERG, on chromosome 7q35-36. Single
	strand conformation polymorphism and DNA sequence analyses reveal
	HERG mutations in six LQT families, including two intragenic deletions,
	one splice-donor mutation, and three missense mutations. In one kindred,
	the mutation arose de novo. Northern blot analyses show that HERG
	is strongly expressed in the heart. These data indicate that HERG
	is LQT2 and suggest a likely cellular mechanism for torsade de pointes.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2002},
  volume = {3},
  pages = {25},
  month = {Sep},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: T-cells are key players in regulating a specific immune
	response. Activation of cytotoxic T-cells requires recognition of
	specific peptides bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC)
	class I molecules. MHC-peptide complexes are potential tools for
	diagnosis and treatment of pathogens and cancer, as well as for the
	development of peptide vaccines. Only one in 100 to 200 potential
	binders actually binds to a certain MHC molecule, therefore a good
	prediction method for MHC class I binding peptides can reduce the
	number of candidate binders that need to be synthesized and tested.
	RESULTS: Here, we present a novel approach, SVMHC, based on support
	vector machines to predict the binding of peptides to MHC class I
	molecules. This method seems to perform slightly better than two
	profile based methods, SYFPEITHI and HLA_BIND. The implementation
	of SVMHC is quite simple and does not involve any manual steps, therefore
	as more data become available it is trivial to provide prediction
	for more MHC types. SVMHC currently contains prediction for 26 MHC
	class I types from the MHCPEP database or alternatively 6 MHC class
	I types from the higher quality SYFPEITHI database. The prediction
	models for these MHC types are implemented in a public web service
	available at http://www.sbc.su.se/svmhc/. CONCLUSIONS: Prediction
	of MHC class I binding peptides using Support Vector Machines, shows
	high performance and is easy to apply to a large number of MHC class
	I types. As more peptide data are put into MHC databases, SVMHC can
	easily be updated to give prediction for additional MHC class I types.
	We suggest that the number of binding peptides needed for SVM training
	is at least 20 sequences.},

	widely different clinical conditions in children, ranging from mild
	flu-like symptoms to coma and death. Despite the immense medical
	implications, the genetic and molecular basis of this diversity remains
	largely unknown. Studies of in vitro gene expression have found few
	transcriptional differences between different parasite strains. Here
	we present a large study of in vivo expression profiles of parasites
	derived directly from blood samples from infected patients. The in
	vivo expression profiles define three distinct transcriptional states.
	The biological basis of these states can be interpreted by comparison
	with an extensive compendium of expression data in the yeast Saccharomyces
	cerevisiae. The three states in vivo closely resemble, first, active
	growth based on glycolytic metabolism, second, a starvation response
	accompanied by metabolism of alternative carbon sources, and third,
	an environmental stress response. The glycolytic state is highly
	similar to the known profile of the ring stage in vitro, but the
	other states have not been observed in vitro. The results reveal
	a previously unknown physiological diversity in the in vivo biology
	of the malaria parasite, in particular evidence for a functional
	mitochondrion in the asexual-stage parasite, and indicate in vivo
	and in vitro studies to determine how this variation may affect disease

	These problems become magnified with automatic modelling processes,

	several stand-alone strategies that could be implemented in a workflow
	for automated high-throughput homology modelling. These include three
	new sequence-structure alignment programs: 3D-Coffee, Staccato and
	SAlign, plus five homology modelling programs and their respective
	loop building methods: Builder, Nest, Modeller, SegMod/ENCAD and
	Swiss-Model. The SABmark database provided 123 targets with at least
	five templates from the same SCOP family and sequence identities

	3D-Coffee outperforms Staccato and SAlign using both multiple templates
	and the best single template, and across the sequence identity range
	20-50\%. The mean model RMSD generated from 3D-Coffee using multiple
	templates is 15 and 28\% (or using single templates, 3 and 13\%)
	better than those generated by Staccato and Salign, respectively.
	3D-Coffee gives equivalent modelling accuracy from multiple and single
	templates, but Staccato and SAlign are more successful with single
	templates, their quality deteriorating as additional lower sequence
	identity templates are added. Evaluating the different homology modelling
	programs, on average Modeller performs marginally better in overall
	modelling than the others tested. However, on average Nest produces
	the best loops with an 8\% improvement by mean RMSD compared to the

	We present a binding site matching score the Poisson Index (PI) based
	upon a well-defined statistical model. PI requires only the number
	of matching atoms between two sites and the size of the two sites-the
	same information used by the Tanimoto Index (TI), a comparable and
	widely used measure for molecular similarity. We apply PI and TI
	to a previously automatically extracted set of binding sites to determine
	the robustness and usefulness of both scores. RESULTS: We found that
	PI outperforms TI; moreover, site similarity is poorly defined for
	TI at values around the 99.5\% confidence level for which PI is well
	defined. A difference map at this confidence level shows that PI
	gives much more meaningful information than TI. We show individual
	examples where TI fails to distinguish either a false or a true site
	paring in contrast to PI, which performs much better. TI cannot handle
	large or small sites very well, or the comparison of large and small
	sites, in contrast to PI that is shown to be much more robust. Despite
	the difficulty of determining a biological 'ground truth' for binding
	site similarity we conclude that PI is a suitable measure of binding
	site similarity and could form the basis for a binding site classification
	scheme comparable to existing protein domain classification schema.},

	wet lab, one by one. To speed up discovery and limit the number of
	costly wet lab experiments, biologists must test the candidate genes
	starting with the most probable candidates. So far, biologists have
	relied on literature studies, extensive queries to multiple databases
	and hunches about expected properties of the disease gene to determine
	such an ordering. Recently, we have introduced the data mining tool
	ENDEAVOUR (Aerts et al., 2006), which performs this task automatically
	by relying on different genome-wide data sources, such as Gene Ontology,
	literature, microarray, sequence and more. RESULTS: In this article,
	we present a novel kernel method that operates in the same setting:
	based on a number of different views on a set of training genes,
	a prioritization of test genes is obtained. We furthermore provide
	a thorough learning theoretical analysis of the method's guaranteed
	performance. Finally, we apply the method to the disease data sets
	on which ENDEAVOUR (Aerts et al., 2006) has been benchmarked, and
	report a considerable improvement in empirical performance. AVAILABILITY:
	The MATLAB code used in the empirical results will be made publicly

  abstract = {In the area of bioinformatics, the identification of gene subsets
	responsible for classifying available disease samples to two or more
	of its variants is an important task. {S}uch problems have been solved
	in the past by means of unsupervised learning methods (hierarchical
	clustering, self-organizing maps, k-mean clustering, etc.) and supervised
	learning methods (weighted voting approach, k-nearest neighbor method,
	support vector machine method, etc.). {S}uch problems can also be
	posed as optimization problems of minimizing gene subset size to
	achieve reliable and accurate classification. {T}he main difficulties
	in solving the resulting optimization problem are the availability
	of only a few samples compared to the number of genes in the samples
	and the exorbitantly large search space of solutions. {A}lthough
	there exist a few applications of evolutionary algorithms ({EA}s)
	for this task, here we treat the problem as a multiobjective optimization
	problem of minimizing the gene subset size and minimizing the number
	of misclassified samples. {M}oreover, for a more reliable classification,
	we consider multiple training sets in evaluating a classifier. {C}ontrary
	to the past studies, the use of a multiobjective {EA} ({NSGA}-{II})
	has enabled us to discover a smaller gene subset size (such as four
	or five) to correctly classify 100\% or near 100\% samples for three
	cancer samples ({L}eukemia, {L}ymphoma, and {C}olon). {W}e have also
	extended the {NSGA}-{II} to obtain multiple non-dominated solutions
	discovering as much as 352 different three-gene combinations providing
	a 100\% correct classification to the {L}eukemia data. {I}n order
	to have further confidence in the identification task, we have also
	introduced a prediction strength threshold for determining a sample's
	belonging to one class or the other. {A}ll simulation results show
	consistent gene subset identifications on three disease samples and
	exhibit the flexibilities and efficacies in using a multiobjective

	images and video is presented. This method, which we refer to as
	JSEG, consists of two independent steps: color quantization and spatial
	segmentation. In the first step, colors in the image are quantized
	to several representative classes that can be used to differentiate
	regions in the image. The image pixels are then replaced by their
	corresponding color class labels, thus forming a class-map of the
	image. The focus of this work is on spatial segmentation, where a
	criterion for "good" segmentation using the class-map is proposed.
	Applying the criterion to local windows in the class-map results
	in the "J-image," in which high and low values correspond to possible
	boundaries and interiors of color-texture regions. A region growing
	method is then used to segment the image based on the multiscale
	J-images. A similar approach is applied to video sequences. An additional
	region tracking scheme is embedded into the region growing process
	to achieve consistent segmentation and tracking results, even for
	scenes with nonrigid object motion. Experiments show the robustness
	of the JSEG algorithm on real images and video.},

	to improve accuracy of supervised learning algorithms? We investigate
	in this paper the design of learning algorithms from positive and
	unlabeled data only. Many machine learning and data mining algorithms,
	such as decision tree induction algorithms and naive Bayes algorithms,
	use examples only to evaluate statistical queries (SQ-like algorithms).
	Kearns designed the statistical query learning model in order to

	transforms any SQ-like algorithm into an algorithm based on positive
	statistical queries (estimate for probabilities over the set of positive
	instances) and instance statistical queries (estimate for probabilities
	over the instance space). We prove that any class learnable in the
	statistical query learning model is learnable from positive statistical
	queries and instance statistical queries only if a lower bound on
	the weight of any target concept f can be estimated in polynomial
	time. Then, we design a decision tree induction algorithm POSC4.5,
	based on C4.5, that uses only positive and unlabeled examples and
	we give experimental results for this algorithm. In the case of imbalanced
	classes in the sense that one of the two classes (say the positive
	class) is heavily underrepresented compared to the other class, the
	learning problem remains open. This problem is challenging because
	it is encountered in many real-world applications.},

	characteristics of its cognate ligands to a common set of conformational
	rearrangements of the TM segments near the G protein binding domains
	during the activation process. Thus, GPCRs have fulfilled this adaptation
	during their evolution by customizing a preserved 7TM scaffold through
	conformational plasticity. We use this term to describe the structural

	2 and 3 provides a remarkable example of conformational plasticity
	within Class A GPCRs. Thus, rhodopsin-based molecular models need
	to include the plasticity of the binding sites among GPCR families,

  number = {7},

  abstract = {Animal genomes contain hundreds of microRNAs (miRNAs), small regulatory
	RNAs that control gene expression by binding to complementary sites
	in target mRNAs. Some rules that govern miRNA/target interaction
	have been elucidated but their general applicability awaits further
	experimentation on a case-by-case basis. We use here an assay system
	in transgenic nematodes to analyze the interaction of the Caenorhabditis
	elegans lsy-6 miRNA with 3' UTR sequences. In contrast to many previously
	described assay systems used to analyze miRNA/target interactions,
	our assay system operates within the cellular context in which lsy-6
	normally functions, a single neuron in the nervous system of C. elegans.
	Through extensive mutational analysis, we define features in the
	known and experimentally validated target of lsy-6, the 3' UTR of
	the cog-1 homeobox gene, that are required for a functional miRNA/target
	interaction. We describe that both in the context of the cog-1 3'
	UTR and in the context of heterologous 3' UTRs, one or more seed
	matches are not a reliable predictor for a functional miRNA/target
	interaction. We rather find that two nonsequence specific contextual
	features beyond miRNA target sites are critical determinants of miRNA-mediated
	3' UTR regulation. The contextual features reside 3' of lsy-6 binding
	sites in the 3' UTR and act in a combinatorial manner; mutation of
	each results in limited defects in 3' UTR regulation, but a combinatorial
	deletion results in complete loss of 3' UTR regulation. Together
	with two lsy-6 sites, these two contextual features are capable of
	imparting regulation on a heterologous 3' UTR. Moreover, the contextual
	features need to be present in a specific configuration relative
	to miRNA binding sites and could either represent protein binding
	sites or provide an appropriate structural context. We conclude that
	a given target site resides in a 3' UTR context that evolved beyond
	target site complementarity to support regulation by a specific miRNA.
	The large number of 3' UTRs that we analyzed in this study will also
	be useful to computational biologists in designing the next generation
	of miRNA/target prediction algorithms.},

	{DESIGN}: {W}e present a radically new approach to the design of
	diagnosis systems. {I}n the new approach, a nonlinear classifier
	with high sensitivity but low specificity is hybridized with a linear
	classifier having low sensitivity but high specificity. {D}ata from
	the {W}isconsin {B}reast {C}ancer {D}atabase are used to evaluate,

	{T}he diagnosis scheme obtained by hybridizing the nonlinear classifier
	ellipsoidal multisurface method ({EMSM}) with the linear classifier
	proximal support vector machine ({PSVM}) was found to have a mean
	sensitivity of 97.36\% and a mean specificity of 95.14\% and was
	found to yield a 2.44\% improvement in the reliability of positive
	diagnosis over that of {EMSM} at the expense of 0.4\% degradation
	in the reliability of negative diagnosis, again compared to {EMSM}.
	{A}t the 95\% confidence level we can trust the hybrid method to
	be 96.19-98.53\% correct in its malignant diagnosis of new tumors
	and 93.57-96.71\% correct in its benign diagnosis. {CONCLUSION}:
	{H}ybrid diagnosis schemes represent a significant paradigm shift

  abstract = {An {RNA} molecule, particularly a long-chain m{RNA}, may exist as
	a population of structures. {F}urther more, multiple structures have
	been demonstrated to play important functional roles. {T}hus, a representation
	of the ensemble of probable structures is of interest. {W}e present
	a statistical algorithm to sample rigorously and exactly from the
	{B}oltzmann ensemble of secondary structures. {T}he forward step
	of the algorithm computes the equilibrium partition functions of
	{RNA} secondary structures with recent thermodynamic parameters.
	{U}sing conditional probabilities computed with the partition functions
	in a recursive sampling process, the backward step of the algorithm
	quickly generates a statistically representative sample of structures.
	{W}ith cubic run time for the forward step, quadratic run time in
	the worst case for the sampling step, and quadratic storage, the
	algorithm is efficient for broad applicability. {W}e demonstrate
	that, by classifying sampled structures, the algorithm enables a
	statistical delineation and representation of the {B}oltzmann ensemble.
	{A}pplications of the algorithm show that alternative biological
	structures are revealed through sampling. {S}tatistical sampling
	provides a means to estimate the probability of any structural motif,
	with or without constraints. {F}or example, the algorithm enables
	probability profiling of single-stranded regions in {RNA} secondary
	structure. {P}robability profiling for specific loop types is also
	illustrated. {B}y overlaying probability profiles, a mutual accessibility
	plot can be displayed for predicting {RNA}:{RNA} interactions. {B}oltzmann
	probability-weighted density of states and free energy distributions
	of sampled structures can be readily computed. {W}e show that a sample
	of moderate size from the ensemble of an enormous number of possible
	structures is sufficient to guarantee statistical reproducibility
	in the estimates of typical sampling statistics. {O}ur applications
	suggest that the sampling algorithm may be well suited to prediction
	of m{RNA} structure and target accessibility. {T}he algorithm is
	applicable to the rational design of small interfering {RNA}s (si{RNA}s),

	In view of extremely high MHC polymorphism (948 class I and 633 class
	II HLA alleles) the experimental solution of this task is presently
	impossible. In this study, we describe a bioinformatics strategy
	for classifying MHC molecules into supertypes using information drawn
	solely from three-dimensional protein structure. Two chemometric
	techniques-hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis-were
	used independently on a set of 783 HLA class I molecules to identify
	supertypes based on structural similarities and molecular interaction
	fields calculated for the peptide binding site. Eight supertypes
	were defined: A2, A3, A24, B7, B27, B44, C1, and C4. The two techniques
	gave 77\% consensus, i.e., 605 HLA class I alleles were classified
	in the same supertype by both methods. The proposed strategy allowed
	"supertype fingerprints" to be identified. Thus, the A2 supertype
	fingerprint is Tyr(9)/Phe(9), Arg(97), and His(114) or Tyr(116);

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Identification of molecular classifiers from genome-wide
	gene expression analysis is an important practice for the investigation
	of biological systems in the post-genomic era--and one with great
	potential for near-term clinical impact. The 'Top-Scoring Pair' (TSP)
	classification method identifies pairs of genes whose relative expression
	correlates strongly with phenotype. In this study, we sought to assess
	the effectiveness of the TSP approach in the identification of diagnostic
	classifiers for a number of human diseases including bacterial and
	viral infection, cardiomyopathy, diabetes, Crohn's disease, and transformed
	ulcerative colitis. We examined transcriptional profiles from both
	solid tissues and blood-borne leukocytes. RESULTS: The algorithm
	identified multiple predictive gene pairs for each phenotype, with
	cross-validation accuracy ranging from 70 to nearly 100 percent,
	and high sensitivity and specificity observed in most classification
	tasks. Performance compared favourably with that of pre-existing
	transcription-based classifiers, and in some cases was comparable
	to the accuracy of current clinical diagnostic procedures. Several
	diseases of solid tissues could be reliably diagnosed through classifiers
	based on the blood-borne leukocyte transcriptome. The TSP classifier
	thus represents a simple yet robust method to differentiate between
	diverse phenotypic states based on gene expression profiles. CONCLUSION:
	Two-transcript classifiers have the potential to reliably classify
	diverse human diseases, through analysis of both local diseased tissue
	and the immunological response assayed through blood-borne leukocytes.
	The experimental simplicity of this method results in measurements
	that can be easily translated to clinical practice.},

  abstract = {The protein product of the human ether-a-go-go gene (hERG) is a potassium
	channel that when inhibited by some drugs may lead to cardiac arrhythmia.
	Previously, a three-dimensional quantitative structure-activity relationship
	(3D-QSAR) pharmacophore model was constructed using Catalyst with
	in vitro inhibition data for antipsychotic agents. The rationale
	of the current study was to use a combination of in vitro and in
	silico technologies to further test the pharmacophore model and qualitatively
	predict whether molecules are likely to inhibit this potassium channel.
	These predictions were assessed with the experimental data using
	the Spearman's rho rank correlation. The antipsychotic-based hERG
	inhibitor model produced a statistically significant Spearman's rho
	of 0.71 for 11 molecules. In addition, 15 molecules from the literature
	were used as a further test set and were also well ranked by the
	same model with a statistically significant Spearman's rho value
	of 0.76. A Catalyst General hERG pharmacophore model was generated
	with these literature molecules, which contained four hydrophobic
	features and one positive ionizable feature. Linear regression of
	log-transformed observed versus predicted IC(50) values for this
	training set resulted in an r(2) value of 0.90. The model based on
	literature data was evaluated with the in vitro data generated for
	the original 22 molecules (including the antipsychotics) and illustrated
	a significant Spearman's rho of 0.77. Thus, the Catalyst 3D-QSAR
	approach provides useful qualitative predictions for test set molecules.
	The model based on literature data therefore provides a potentially
	valuable tool for discovery chemistry as future molecules may be
	synthesized that are less likely to inhibit hERG based on information
	provided by a pharmacophore for the inhibition of this potassium
	channel.},

	of medical images from a database, and provide a preliminary demonstration
	of our approach as applied to retrieval of digital mammograms. {C}ontent-based
	image retrieval ({CBIR}) refers to the retrieval of images from a
	database using information derived from the images themselves, rather
	than solely from accompanying text indices. {I}n the medical-imaging
	context, the ultimate aim of {CBIR} is to provide radiologists with
	a diagnostic aid in the form of a display of relevant past cases,
	along with proven pathology and other suitable information. {CBIR}
	may also be useful as a training tool for medical students and residents.
	{T}he goal of information retrieval is to recall from a database
	information that is relevant to the user's query. {T}he most challenging
	aspect of {CBIR} is the definition of relevance (similarity), which
	is used to guide the retrieval machine. {I}n this paper, we pursue
	a new approach, in which similarity is learned from training examples
	provided by human observers. {S}pecifically, we explore the use of
	neural networks and support vector machines to predict the user's
	notion of similarity. {W}ithin this framework we propose using a
	hierarchal learning approach, which consists of a cascade of a binary
	classifier and a regression module to optimize retrieval effectiveness
	and efficiency. {W}e also explore how to incorporate online human
	interaction to achieve relevance feedback in this learning framework.
	{O}ur experiments are based on a database consisting of 76 mammograms,
	all of which contain clustered microcalcifications ({MC}s). {O}ur
	goal is to retrieve mammogram images containing similar {MC} clusters
	to that in a query. {T}he performance of the retrieval system is
	evaluated using precision-recall curves computed using a cross-validation
	procedure. {O}ur experimental results demonstrate that: 1) the learning
	framework can accurately predict the perceptual similarity reported
	by human observers, thereby serving as a basis for {CBIR}; 2) the
	learning-based framework can significantly outperform a simple distance-based
	similarity metric; 3) the use of the hierarchical two-stage network
	can improve retrieval performance; and 4) relevance feedback can
	be effectively incorporated into this learning framework to achieve
	improvement in retrieval precision based on online interaction with
	users; and 5) the retrieved images by the network can have predicting
	value for the disease condition of the query.},

	problems with reproducibility and consistency. In the Nottingham/Tenovus
	Primary Breast Cancer Study the most commonly used method, described
	by Bloom & Richardson, has been modified in order to make the criteria
	more objective. The revised technique involves semiquantitative evaluation
	of three morphological features--the percentage of tubule formation,
	the degree of nuclear pleomorphism and an accurate mitotic count
	using a defined field area. A numerical scoring system is used and
	the overall grade is derived from a summation of individual scores
	for the three variables: three grades of differentiation are used.
	Since 1973, over 2200 patients with primary operable breast cancer
	have been entered into a study of multiple prognostic factors. Histological
	grade, assessed in 1831 patients, shows a very strong correlation

	better survival than those with grade II and III tumours (P less

	lower-bounded by the capacity of the channel induced by this class.
	{S}ince this result holds for general classes of sources, it extends
	{R}issanen's (1986) strong converse theorem for parametric families.
	{W}hile our earlier result has established strong optimality only
	for mixture codes weighted by the capacity-achieving prior, our first
	result herein extends this finding to a general prior. {F}or some

	mentioned strong converse theorem. {T}he major interest in this paper,
	however, is in extending the theory of universal coding to hierarchical
	structures of classes, where each class may have a different capacity.
	{I}n this setting, one wishes to incur redundancy essentially as
	small as that corresponding to the active class, and not the union
	of classes. {O}ur main result is that the redundancy of a code based
	on a two-stage mixture (first, within each class, and then over the
	classes), is no worse than that of any other code for ?most? sources
	of ?most? classes. {I}f, in addition, the classes can be efficiently
	distinguished by a certain decision rule, then the best attainable
	redundancy is given explicitly by the capacity of the active class
	plus the normalized negative logarithm of the prior probability assigned
	to this class. {T}hese results suggest some interesting guidelines
	as for the choice of the prior. {W}e also discuss some examples with

	prognosis in breast cancer. This prognostic value may rely in part
	on the fact that p53 plays a role in the antiproliferative and apoptotic
	activities of chemotherapy regimens used to treat breast tumors.
	However, some studies suggested that p53 may also influence response
	to antihormone treatments. Here we investigate how p53 may affect
	response to antihormonal treatments, using estrogen-dependent breast
	cancer cell-lines with different p53 status. We show that p53 mutated
	cells were more resistant to cytotoxic effects of 4-hydroxy-tamoxifen
	(OHT) compared to p53 wild-type cells. In contrast, p53 status did
	not significantly impact on response to fulvestrant. p53 mutated
	cells were also hypersensitive to proliferative effects of estradiol.
	Interestingly, OHT at doses in the low range had proliferative activities
	in p53 mutated cells (120-150\% proliferation rate under 1 muM OHT
	treatment in low estrogen conditions). Using gene silencing or specific
	tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we show that the proliferative effects
	of OHT were estrogen receptor dependent and could be abrogated by
	the inhibition of EGFR and/or HER2 kinases. These findings suggest
	that loss of p53 function may increase cross-talks between estrogen
	receptor and EGFR/HER2 pathways, contributing to a proliferative
	effect of OHT. These results bring new insights into the prognostic

	two separable and functionally essential domains: an N-terminal domain
	which binds to specific DNA sequences (UASG); and a C-terminal domain
	containing acidic regions, which is necessary to activate transcription.
	We have generated a system of two hybrid proteins containing parts
	of GAL4: the GAL4 DNA-binding domain fused to a protein 'X' and a
	GAL4 activating region fused to a protein 'Y'. If X and Y can form
	a protein-protein complex and reconstitute proximity of the GAL4
	domains, transcription of a gene regulated by UASG occurs. We have
	tested this system using two yeast proteins that are known to interact--SNF1
	and SNF4. High transcriptional activity is obtained only when both
	hybrids are present in a cell. This system may be applicable as a
	general method to identify proteins that interact with a known protein
	by the use of a simple galactose selection.},

	subtypes with different prognosis. However, evolution remains difficult
	to predict within some subtypes, such as luminal A, and treatment
	is not as adapted as it should be. Refinement of prognostic classification
	and identification of new therapeutic targets are needed. Using oligonucleotide

	on two major breast cancer subtypes with opposite prognosis, luminal
	A (n = 80) and basal (n = 58), and on genes encoding protein kinases.
	Whole-kinome expression separated luminal A and basal tumors. The
	expression (measured by a kinase score) of 16 genes encoding serine/threonine
	kinases involved in mitosis distinguished two subgroups of luminal
	A tumors: Aa, of good prognosis and Ab, of poor prognosis. This classification
	and its prognostic effect were validated in 276 luminal A cases from
	three independent series profiled across different microarray platforms.
	The classification outperformed the current prognostic factors in
	univariate and multivariate analyses in both training and validation
	sets. The luminal Ab subgroup, characterized by high mitotic activity
	compared with luminal Aa tumors, displayed clinical characteristics
	and a kinase score intermediate between the luminal Aa subgroup and
	the luminal B subtype, suggesting a continuum in luminal tumors.
	Some of the mitotic kinases of the signature represent therapeutic

	of poor prognosis should help select appropriate treatment, whereas
	the identification of a relevant kinase set provides potential targets.},

	cell membranes seven times (7-TM receptors) were the focus of a symposium
	in Stockholm 2006. The ensemble of GPCR has now been mapped in several
	animal species. They remain a major focus of interest in drug development,
	and their diverse physiological and pathophysiological roles are
	being clarified, i.a. by genetic targeting. Recent developments hint
	at novel levels of complexity. First, many, if not all, GPCRs are
	part of multimeric ensembles, and physiology and pharmacology of
	a given GPCR may be at least partly guided by the partners it was
	formed together with. Secondly, at least some GPCRs may be constitutively
	active. Therefore, drugs that are inverse agonists may prove useful.
	Furthermore, the level of activity may vary in such a profound way
	between cells and tissues that this could offer new ways of achieving
	specificity of drug action. Finally, it is becoming increasingly
	clear that some of these receptors can signal via novel types of
	pathways, and hence that 'GPCRs' may not always be G-protein-coupled.
	Thus there are many challenges for the basic scientist and the drug
	industry.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {50},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Proteochemometrics is a new methodology that allows prediction
	of protein function directly from real interaction measurement data
	without the need of 3D structure information. Several reported proteochemometric
	models of ligand-receptor interactions have already yielded significant
	insights into various forms of bio-molecular interactions. The proteochemometric
	models are multivariate regression models that predict binding affinity
	for a particular combination of features of the ligand and protein.
	Although proteochemometric models have already offered interesting
	results in various studies, no detailed statistical evaluation of
	their average predictive power has been performed. In particular,
	variable subset selection performed to date has always relied on
	using all available examples, a situation also encountered in microarray
	gene expression data analysis. RESULTS: A methodology for an unbiased
	evaluation of the predictive power of proteochemometric models was
	implemented and results from applying it to two of the largest proteochemometric
	data sets yet reported are presented. A double cross-validation loop
	procedure is used to estimate the expected performance of a given
	design method. The unbiased performance estimates (P2) obtained for
	the data sets that we consider confirm that properly designed single
	proteochemometric models have useful predictive power, but that a
	standard design based on cross validation may yield models with quite
	limited performance. The results also show that different commercial
	software packages employed for the design of proteochemometric models
	may yield very different and therefore misleading performance estimates.
	In addition, the differences in the models obtained in the double
	CV loop indicate that detailed chemical interpretation of a single
	proteochemometric model is uncertain when data sets are small. CONCLUSION:
	The double CV loop employed offer unbiased performance estimates
	about a given proteochemometric modelling procedure, making it possible
	to identify cases where the proteochemometric design does not result
	in useful predictive models. Chemical interpretations of single proteochemometric
	models are uncertain and should instead be based on all the models
	selected in the double CV loop employed here.},

	the corresponding {A}z values were 98.00\% for the {SVM} and 97.80\%
	for the {GRNN}. {T}he {SVM} outperformed the {GRNN}, whether or not
	the input vectors first underwent {SFS} feature selection. {I}n both
	cases, feature selection dramatically reduced the dimension of the
	input vectors (82\% for the {SVM} and 59\% for the {GRNN}). {M}oreover,
	{SFS} feature selection improved the classification performance,

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Identifying transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs)
	encoding complex regulatory signals in metazoan genomes remains a
	challenging problem in computational genomics. Due to degeneracy
	of nucleotide content among binding site instances or motifs, and
	intricate 'grammatical organization' of motifs within cis-regulatory
	modules (CRMs), extant pattern matching-based in silico motif search
	methods often suffer from impractically high false positive rates,
	especially in the context of analyzing large genomic datasets, and
	noisy position weight matrices which characterize binding sites.
	Here, we try to address this problem by using a framework to maximally
	utilize the information content of the genomic DNA in the region
	of query, taking cues from values of various biologically meaningful
	genetic and epigenetic factors in the query region such as clade-specific
	evolutionary parameters, presence/absence of nearby coding regions,
	etc. We present a new method for TFBS prediction in metazoan genomes
	that utilizes both the CRM architecture of sequences and a variety
	of features of individual motifs. Our proposed approach is based
	on a discriminative probabilistic model known as conditional random
	fields that explicitly optimizes the predictive probability of motif
	presence in large sequences, based on the joint effect of all such
	features. RESULTS: This model overcomes weaknesses in earlier methods
	based on less effective statistical formalisms that are sensitive
	to spurious signals in the data. We evaluate our method on both simulated
	CRMs and real Drosophila sequences in comparison with a wide spectrum
	of existing models, and outperform the state of the art by 22\% in
	F1 score. Availability and Implementation: The code is publicly available
	at http://www.sailing.cs.cmu.edu/discover.html. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:

  abstract = {We present a new approach to molecular classification based on mRNA
	comparisons. Our method, referred to as the top-scoring pair(s) (TSP)
	classifier, is motivated by current technical and practical limitations
	in using gene expression microarray data for class prediction, for
	example to detect disease, identify tumors or predict treatment response.
	Accurate statistical inference from such data is difficult due to
	the small number of observations, typically tens, relative to the
	large number of genes, typically thousands. Moreover, conventional
	methods from machine learning lead to decisions which are usually
	very difficult to interpret in simple or biologically meaningful
	terms. In contrast, the TSP classifier provides decision rules which
	i) involve very few genes and only relative expression values (e.g.,
	comparing the mRNA counts within a single pair of genes); ii) are
	both accurate and transparent; and iii) provide specific hypotheses
	for follow-up studies. In particular, the TSP classifier achieves
	prediction rates with standard cancer data that are as high as those
	of previous studies which use considerably more genes and complex
	procedures. Finally, the TSP classifier is parameter-free, thus avoiding
	the type of over-fitting and inflated estimates of performance that
	result when all aspects of learning a predictor are not properly
	cross-validated.},

	The amplitude of the oscillations was much more variable than the

	Other cells showed low-frequency fluctuations that did not resemble

	low-frequency noise in protein production rates, rather than noise

	can be valuable in determining protein function. Once the binding
	site is known, it becomes easier to perform in silico and experimental
	procedures that may allow the ligand type and the protein function
	to be determined. For example, binding pocket shape analysis relies
	heavily on the correct localization of the ligand binding site. We
	have developed SURFNET-ConSurf, a modular, two-stage method for identifying
	the location and shape of potential ligand binding pockets in protein
	structures. In the first stage, the SURFNET program identifies clefts
	in the protein surface that are potential binding sites. In the second
	stage, these clefts are trimmed in size by cutting away regions distant
	from highly conserved residues, as defined by the ConSurf-HSSP database.
	The largest clefts that remain tend to be those where ligands bind.
	To test the approach, we analyzed a nonredundant set of 244 protein
	structures from the PDB and found that SURFNET-ConSurf identifies
	a ligand binding pocket in 75\% of them. The trimming procedure reduces
	the original cleft volumes by 30\% on average, while still encompassing
	an average 87\% of the ligand volume. From the analysis of the results
	we conclude that for those cases in which the ligands are found in
	large, highly conserved clefts, the combined SURFNET-ConSurf method
	gives pockets that are a better match to the ligand shape and location.
	We also show that this approach works better for enzymes than for

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Many statistical tests have been proposed in recent years
	for analyzing gene expression data in terms of gene sets, usually
	from Gene Ontology. These methods are based on widely different methodological
	assumptions. Some approaches test differential expression of each
	gene set against differential expression of the rest of the genes,
	whereas others test each gene set on its own. Also, some methods
	are based on a model in which the genes are the sampling units, whereas
	others treat the subjects as the sampling units. This article aims
	to clarify the assumptions behind different approaches and to indicate
	a preferential methodology of gene set testing. RESULTS: We identify
	some crucial assumptions which are needed by the majority of methods.
	P-values derived from methods that use a model which takes the genes
	as the sampling unit are easily misinterpreted, as they are based
	on a statistical model that does not resemble the biological experiment
	actually performed. Furthermore, because these models are based on
	a crucial and unrealistic independence assumption between genes,
	the P-values derived from such methods can be wildly anti-conservative,
	as a simulation experiment shows. We also argue that methods that
	competitively test each gene set against the rest of the genes create
	an unnecessary rift between single gene testing and gene set testing.},

	genomics projects have increased the need for automatic structure
	analysis and tools for function prediction. Small molecule recognition
	is critical to the function of many proteins; therefore, determination
	of ligand binding site similarity is important for understanding

	Here, we present a binding sites database (SitesBase) that given
	a known protein-ligand binding site allows rapid retrieval of other
	binding sites with similar structure independent of overall sequence
	or fold similarity. However, each match is also annotated with sequence
	similarity and fold information to aid interpretation of structure
	and functional similarity. Similarity in ligand binding sites can
	indicate common binding modes and recognition of similar molecules,
	allowing potential inference of function for an uncharacterised protein
	or providing additional evidence of common function where sequence
	or fold similarity is already known. Alternatively, the resource
	can provide valuable information for detailed studies of molecular
	recognition including structure-based ligand design and in understanding
	ligand cross-reactivity. Here, we show examples of atomic similarity
	between superfamily or more distant fold relatives as well as between
	seemingly unrelated proteins. Assignment of unclassified proteins
	to structural superfamiles is also undertaken and in most cases substantiates
	assignments made using sequence similarity. Correct assignment is
	also possible where sequence similarity fails to find significant
	matches, illustrating the potential use of binding site comparisons

	$\alpha>1$, that is, there are many more explanatory variables than
	observations. We consider sets Bn restricted by the maximal number
	of non-zero coefficients of their members, or by their l1 radius.
	We study the following asymptotic question: how 'large' may the set
	Bn be, so that it is still possible to select empirically a predictor
	whose risk under F is close to that of the best predictor in the
	set? Sharp bounds for orders of magnitudes are given under various
	assumptions on ${\cal F}$. Algorithmic complexity of the ensuing
	procedures is also studied. The main message of this paper and the
	implications of the orders derived are that under various sparsity
	assumptions on the optimal predictor there is 'asymptotically no
	harm' in introducing many more explanatory variables than observations.
	Furthermore, such practice can be beneficial in comparison with a
	procedure that screens in advance a small subset of explanatory variables.
	Another main result is that 'lasso' procedures, that is, optimization
	under l1 constraints, could be efficient in finding optimal sparse
	predictors in high dimensions.},

	are superior to sequence motifs. The neural net is superior to simple
	motif searches in eliminating false positives. Its behavior can be
	coarsely tuned to the strength of binding desired and it is extendable
	in a straightforward fashion to other alleles. The polynomial method,
	on the other hand, has high sensitivity and is a superior method

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: During the last years, several groups have identified
	prognostic gene expression signatures with apparently similar performances.
	However, signatures were never compared on an independent population
	of untreated breast cancer patients, where risk assessment was computed
	using the original algorithms and microarray platforms. RESULTS:
	We compared three gene expression signatures, the 70-gene, the 76-gene
	and the Gene expression Grade Index (GGI) signatures, in terms of
	predicting distant metastasis free survival (DMFS) for the individual
	patient. To this end, we used the previously published TRANSBIG independent
	validation series of node-negative untreated primary breast cancer
	patients. We observed agreement in prediction for 135 of 198 patients
	(68\%) when considering the three signatures. When comparing the
	signatures two by two, the agreement in prediction was 71\% for the
	70- and 76-gene signatures, 76\% for the 76-gene signature and the
	GGI, and 88\% for the 70-gene signature and the GGI. The three signatures
	had similar capabilities of predicting DMFS and added significant
	prognostic information to that provided by the classical parameters.
	CONCLUSION: Despite the difference in development of these signatures
	and the limited overlap in gene identity, they showed similar prognostic
	performance, adding to the growing evidence that these prognostic
	signatures are of clinical relevance.},

	{T}wo reasons are largely responsible for the maturity of the computational

	of the "correct" native conformation within the list of predicted
	docked conformations signals a near solution to the docking problem,
	has been replaced by the stark realization of the extreme difficulty
	of the next scoring/ranking step. {S}econd, in the last couple of
	years more realistic approaches to handling molecular flexibility
	in docking schemes have emerged. {A}s in folding, these derive from
	concepts abstracted from statistical mechanics, namely, populations.
	{D}ocking and folding are interrelated. {F}rom the purely physical
	standpoint, binding and folding are analogous processes, with similar
	underlying principles. {C}omputationally, the tools developed for
	docking will be tremendously useful for folding. {F}or large, multidomain
	proteins, domain docking is probably the only rational way, mimicking
	the hierarchical nature of protein folding. {T}he complexity of the
	problem is huge. {H}ere we divide the computational docking problem
	into its two separate components. {A}s in folding, solving the docking
	problem involves efficient search (and matching) algorithms, which
	cover the relevant conformational space, and selective scoring functions,
	which are both efficient and effectively discriminate between native
	and non-native solutions. {I}t is universally recognized that docking
	of drugs is immensely important. {H}owever, protein-protein docking
	is equally so, relating to recognition, cellular pathways, and macromolecular
	assemblies. {P}roteins function when they are bound to other molecules.
	{C}onsequently, we present the review from both the computational
	and the biological points of view. {A}lthough large, it covers only
	partially the extensive body of literature, relating to small (drug)
	and to large protein-protein molecule docking, to rigid and to flexible.
	{U}nfortunately, when reviewing these, a major difficulty in assessing
	the results is the non-uniformity in the formats in which they are

  abstract = {Apoptosis is an essential process to get rid of injured or unwanted
	cells. In this study, we proposed a mathematical modeling for death
	receptor mediated apoptosis to investigate the role of c-FLIP in
	controlling the balance between apoptosis and survival. In order
	to get insight into how NF-kappa B mediated pro-survival pathway
	affects the outcome of our modeling, we implemented reduced models
	without taking such regulation into consideration. Our simulation
	revealed that c-FLIP could act as a pivotal death or life switch
	and this switch-like behavior is bistable, irreversible, and robust.
	We introduce a new term, probability apoptosis, to delineate the
	likelihood in occurrence of apoptosis events. This simulation system
	is plausible and may offer several valuable clinical indications
	for the abnormal apoptosis related disease, such as cancer.},

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {C}urrently, the most accurate fold-recognition method
	is to perform profile-profile alignments and estimate the statistical
	significances of those alignments by calculating {Z}-score or {E}-value.
	{A}lthough this scheme is reliable in recognizing relatively close
	homologs related at the family level, it has difficulty in finding
	the remote homologs that are related at the superfamily or fold level.
	{RESULTS}: {I}n this paper, we present an alternative method to estimate
	the significance of the alignments. {T}he alignment between a query
	protein and a template of length n in the fold library is transformed
	into a feature vector of length n + 1, which is then evaluated by
	support vector machine ({SVM}). {T}he output from {SVM} is converted
	to a posterior probability that a query sequence is related to a
	template, given {SVM} output. {R}esults show that a new method shows
	significantly better performance than {PSI}-{BLAST} and profile-profile
	alignment with {Z}-score scheme. {W}hile {PSI}-{BLAST} and {Z}-score
	scheme detect 16 and 20\% of superfamily-related proteins, respectively,
	at 90\% specificity, a new method detects 46\% of these proteins,
	resulting in more than 2-fold increase in sensitivity. {M}ore significantly,
	at the fold level, a new method can detect 14\% of remotely related
	proteins at 90\% specificity, a remarkable result considering the
	fact that the other methods can detect almost none at the same level
	of specificity.},

	between their respective segmentation graphs. The kernels are based
	on soft matching of subtree-patterns of the respective graphs, leveraging
	the natural structure of images while remaining robust to the associated
	segmentation process uncertainty. Indeed, output from morphological
	segmentation is often represented by a labelled graph, each vertex
	corresponding to a segmented region, with edges joining neighboring
	regions. However, such image representations have mostly remained
	underused for learning tasks, partly because of the observed instability
	of the segmentation process and the inherent hardness of inexact
	graph matching with uncertain graphs. Our kernels count common virtual
	substructures amongst images, which enables to perform efficient
	supervised classification of natural images with a support vector
	machine. Moreover, the kernel machinery allows us to take advantage
	of recent advances in kernel-based learning: (i) semi-supervised
	learning reduces the required number of labelled images, while (ii)
	multiple kernel learning algorithms efficiently select the most relevant
	similarity measures between images within our family.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Published reports suggest that DNA microarrays identify clinically
	meaningful subtypes of lung adenocarcinomas not recognizable by other
	routine tests. This report is an investigation of the reproducibility
	of the reported tumor subtypes. METHODS: Three independent cohorts
	of patients with lung cancer were evaluated using a variety of DNA
	microarray assays. Using the integrative correlations method, a subset
	of genes was selected, the reliability of which was acceptable across
	the different DNA microarray platforms. Tumor subtypes were selected
	using consensus clustering and genes distinguishing subtypes were
	identified using the weighted difference statistic. Gene lists were
	compared across cohorts using centroids and gene set enrichment analysis.
	RESULTS: Cohorts of 31, 72, and 128 adenocarcinomas were generated
	for a total of 231 microarrays, each with 2,553 reliable genes. Three
	adenocarcinoma subtypes were identified in each cohort. These were
	named bronchioid, squamoid, and magnoid according to their respective
	correlations with gene expression patterns from histologically defined
	bronchioalveolar carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and large-cell
	carcinoma. Tumor subtypes were distinguishable by many hundreds of
	genes, and lists generated in one cohort were predictive of tumor
	subtypes in the two other cohorts. Tumor subtypes correlated with
	clinically relevant covariates, including stage-specific survival
	and metastatic pattern. Most notably, bronchioid tumors were correlated
	with improved survival in early-stage disease, whereas squamoid tumors
	were associated with better survival in advanced disease. CONCLUSION:
	DNA microarray analysis of lung adenocarcinomas identified reproducible
	tumor subtypes which differ significantly in clinically important
	behaviors such as stage-specific survival.},

	In contrast to almost all other work in this area, we train a single

	We are therefore able to leverage data across all HLA alleles and/or

	be shared and also how to combine allele-specific, supertype-specific,
	and global information in a principled way. We show that this leveraging
	can improve prediction of epitopes having HLA alleles with known
	supertypes, and dramatically increases our ability to predict epitopes
	having alleles which do not fall into any of the known supertypes.
	Our model, which is based on logistic regression, is simple to implement
	and understand, is solved by finding a single global maximum, and
	is more accurate (to our knowledge) than any other model.},

  abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Breast cancers can be classified using whole genome
	expression into distinct subtypes that show differences in prognosis.
	One of these groups, the basal-like subtype, is poorly differentiated,
	highly metastatic, genomically unstable, and contains specific genetic
	alterations such as the loss of tumour protein 53 (TP53). The loss
	of the retinoblastoma tumour suppressor encoded by the RB1 locus
	is a well-characterised occurrence in many tumour types; however,
	its role in breast cancer is less clear with many reports demonstrating
	a loss of heterozygosity that does not correlate with a loss of RB1
	protein expression. METHODS: We used gene expression analysis for
	tumour subtyping and polymorphic markers located at the RB1 locus
	to assess the frequency of loss of heterozygosity in 88 primary human
	breast carcinomas and their normal tissue genomic DNA samples. RESULTS:
	RB1 loss of heterozygosity was observed at an overall frequency of
	39\%, with a high frequency in basal-like (72\%) and luminal B (62\%)
	tumours. These tumours also concurrently showed low expression of
	RB1 mRNA. p16INK4a was highly expressed in basal-like tumours, presumably
	due to a previously reported feedback loop caused by RB1 loss. An
	RB1 loss of heterozygosity signature was developed and shown to be
	highly prognostic, and was potentially a predictive marker of response
	to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that
	the functional loss of RB1 is common in basal-like tumours, which
	may play a key role in dictating their aggressive biology and unique
	therapeutic responses.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: The development of epitope-based vaccines crucially relies
	on the ability to classify Human Leukocyte Antigen (HLA) molecules
	into sets that have similar peptide binding specificities, termed
	supertypes. In their seminal work, Sette and Sidney defined nine
	HLA class I supertypes and claimed that these provide an almost perfect
	coverage of the entire repertoire of HLA class I molecules. HLA alleles
	are highly polymorphic and polygenic and therefore experimentally
	classifying each of these molecules to supertypes is at present an
	impossible task. Recently, a number of computational methods have
	been proposed for this task. These methods are based on defining
	protein similarity measures, derived from analysis of binding peptides
	or from analysis of the proteins themselves. RESULTS: In this paper
	we define both peptide derived and protein derived similarity measures,
	which are based on learning distance functions. The peptide derived
	measure is defined using a peptide-peptide distance function, which
	is learned using information about known binding and non-binding
	peptides. The protein derived similarity measure is defined using
	a protein-protein distance function, which is learned using information
	about alleles previously classified to supertypes by Sette and Sidney
	(1999). We compare the classification obtained by these two complimentary
	methods to previously suggested classification methods. In general,
	our results are in excellent agreement with the classifications suggested
	by Sette and Sidney (1999) and with those reported by Buus et al.
	(2004). The main important advantage of our proposed distance-based
	approach is that it makes use of two different and important immunological
	sources of information-HLA alleles and peptides that are known to
	bind or not bind to these alleles. Since each of our distance measures
	is trained using a different source of information, their combination
	can provide a more confident classification of alleles to supertypes.},

  year = {2006},

  pages = {S3},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many different aspects of cellular signalling, trafficking
	and targeting mechanisms are mediated by interactions between proteins
	and peptides. Representative examples are MHC-peptide complexes in
	the immune system. Developing computational methods for protein-peptide
	binding prediction is therefore an important task with applications
	to vaccine and drug design. METHODS: Previous learning approaches
	address the binding prediction problem using traditional margin based
	binary classifiers. In this paper we propose PepDist: a novel approach
	for predicting binding affinity. Our approach is based on learning
	peptide-peptide distance functions. Moreover, we suggest to learn
	a single peptide-peptide distance function over an entire family
	of proteins (e.g. MHC class I). This distance function can be used
	to compute the affinity of a novel peptide to any of the proteins
	in the given family. In order to learn these peptide-peptide distance
	functions, we formalize the problem as a semi-supervised learning
	problem with partial information in the form of equivalence constraints.
	Specifically, we propose to use DistBoost, which is a semi-supervised
	distance learning algorithm. RESULTS: We compare our method to various
	state-of-the-art binding prediction algorithms on MHC class I and
	MHC class II datasets. In almost all cases, our method outperforms
	all of its competitors. One of the major advantages of our novel
	approach is that it can also learn an affinity function over proteins
	for which only small amounts of labeled peptides exist. In these
	cases, our method's performance gain, when compared to other computational
	methods, is even more pronounced. We have recently uploaded the PepDist
	webserver which provides binding prediction of peptides to 35 different
	MHC class I alleles. The webserver which can be found at http://www.pepdist.cs.huji.ac.il
	is powered by a prediction engine which was trained using the framework
	presented in this paper. CONCLUSION: The results obtained suggest
	that learning a single distance function over an entire family of
	proteins achieves higher prediction accuracy than learning a set
	of binary classifiers for each of the proteins separately. We also
	show the importance of obtaining information on experimentally determined
	non-binders. Learning with real non-binders generalizes better than
	learning with randomly generated peptides that are assumed to be
	non-binders. This suggests that information about non-binding peptides
	should also be published and made publicly available.},

	device is well suited to testing the breath of patients receiving
	mechanical ventilation and is a potential diagnostic adjunct that
	can aid in the detection of patients with ventilator-associated pneumonia.
	{STUDY} {DESIGN}: {A} prospective study. {METHODS}: {W}e performed
	a prospective study of patients receiving mechanical ventilation
	in a surgical intensive care unit who underwent chest computed tomography
	({CT}) scanning. {A} single attending radiologist reviewed the chest
	{CT} scans, and imaging features were recorded on a standardized
	form. {W}ithin 48 hours of chest {CT} scan, five sets of exhaled
	gas were sampled from the expiratory limb of the ventilator circuit.
	{T}he gases were assayed with a commercially available electronic
	nose. {B}oth linear and nonlinear analyses were performed to identify
	correlations between imaging features and the assayed gas signatures.
	{RESULTS}: {T}wenty-five patients were identified, 13 of whom were
	diagnosed with pneumonia by {CT} scan. {S}upport vector machine analysis
	was performed in two separate analyses. {I}n the first analysis,
	in which a training set was identical to a prediction set, the accuracy
	of prediction results was greater than 91.6\%. {I}n the second analysis,
	in which the training set and the prediction set were different,
	the accuracy of prediction results was at least 80\%, with higher
	accuracy depending on the specific parameters and models being used.
	{CONCLUSION}: {T}he electronic nose is a new technology that continues
	to show promise as a potential diagnostic adjunct in the diagnosis
	of pneumonia and other infectious diseases.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND:Predicting which molecules can bind to a given binding
	site of a protein with known 3D structure is important to decipher
	the protein function, and useful in drug design. A classical assumption
	in structural biology is that proteins with similar 3D structures
	have related molecular functions, and therefore may bind similar
	ligands. However, proteins that do not display any overall sequence
	or structure similarity may also bind similar ligands if they contain
	similar binding sites. Quantitatively assessing the similarity between
	binding sites may therefore be useful to propose new ligands for
	a given pocket, based on those known for similar pockets.RESULTS:We
	propose a new method to quantify the similarity between binding pockets,
	and explore its relevance for ligand prediction. We represent each
	pocket by a cloud of atoms, and assess the similarity between two
	pockets by aligning their atoms in the 3D space and comparing the
	resulting configurations with a convolution kernel. Pocket alignment
	and comparison is possible even when the corresponding proteins share
	no sequence or overall structure similarities. In order to predict
	ligands for a given target pocket, we compare it to an ensemble of
	pockets with known ligands to identify the most similar pockets.
	We discuss two criteria to evaluate the performance of a binding
	pocket similarity measure in the context of ligand prediction, namely,
	area under ROC curve (AUC scores) and classification based scores.
	We show that the latter is better suited to evaluate the methods
	with respect to ligand prediction, and demonstrate the relevance
	of our new binding site similarity compared to existing similarity
	measures.CONCLUSIONS:This study demonstrates the relevance of the
	proposed method to identify ligands binding to known binding pockets.
	We also provide a new benchmark for future work in this field. The
	new method and the benchmark are available at http://cbio.ensmp.fr/paris},

	If cancer is such a complex system, how can one ever predict the

	the relative performance of 2D vs 3D descriptors, (2) the importance
	of the similarity scoring function for a given descriptor set, and
	(3) binary or Fuzzy Pharmacophore Fingerprints-can they capture the
	similarity of the spatial distribution of pharmacophoric groups despite
	different molecular connectivity? It was found that fuzzy pharmacophore
	descriptors (FBPA) displayed an optimal NB and, unlike their binary
	counterparts, were successful in evidencing pharmacophore pattern
	similarity independently of topological similarity. Topological FBPA,
	identical to the former except for the use of topological instead
	of 3D atom pair distances, display a somehow weaker, but significant
	NB. Metrics based on "classical" global 2D and 3D molecular descriptors

	of the appropriate molecular descriptors.},

	expressed protein is critical to a full understanding of its function.
	{F}luorescence microscopy, in combination with methods for fluorescent
	tagging, is the most suitable current method for proteome-wide determination
	of subcellular location. {P}revious work has shown that neural network
	classifiers can distinguish all major protein subcellular location
	patterns in both 2{D} and 3{D} fluorescence microscope images. {B}uilding
	on these results, we evaluate here new classifiers and features to
	improve the recognition of protein subcellular location patterns
	in both 2{D} and 3{D} fluorescence microscope images. {R}esults {W}e
	report here a thorough comparison of the performance on this problem
	of eight different state-of-the-art classification methods, including
	neural networks, support vector machines with linear, polynomial,
	radial basis, and exponential radial basis kernel functions, and
	ensemble methods such as {A}da{B}oost, {B}agging, and {M}ixtures-of-{E}xperts.
	{T}en-fold cross validation was used to evaluate each classifier
	with various parameters on different {S}ubcellular {L}ocation {F}eature
	sets representing both 2{D} and 3{D} fluorescence microscope images,
	including new feature sets incorporating features derived from {G}abor
	and {D}aubechies wavelet transforms. {A}fter optimal parameters were
	chosen for each of the eight classifiers, optimal majority-voting
	ensemble classifiers were formed for each feature set. {C}omparison
	of results for each image for all eight classifiers permits estimation
	of the lower bound classification error rate for each subcellular
	pattern, which we interpret to reflect the fraction of cells whose
	patterns are distorted by mitosis, cell death or acquisition errors.
	{O}verall, we obtained statistically significant improvements in
	classification accuracy over the best previously published results,
	with the overall error rate being reduced by one-third to one-half
	and with the average accuracy for single 2{D} images being higher
	than 90% for the first time. {I}n particular, the classification
	accuracy for the easily confused endomembrane compartments (endoplasmic

	{T}he availability of accurate, fast, automated classification systems

	cancer diagnosis by recursive feature elimination with support vector

	microarray data faces many challenges the most serious one being
	the presence of thousands of genes and only several dozens (at the
	best) of patient's samples. {T}hus, making any kind of classification
	in high-dimensional spaces from a limited number of data is both
	an extremely difficult and a prone to an error procedure. {T}he improved
	{RFE}-{SVM}s is introduced and used here for an elimination of less
	relevant genes and just for a reduction of the overall number of

	why and how the, usually neglected, penalty parameter {C} and some
	standard data preprocessing techniques (normalizing and scaling)
	influence classification results and the gene selection of {RFE}-{SVM}s.
	{T}he gene selected by {RFE}-{SVM}s is compared with eight other

	{T}he improved {RFE}-{SVM}s is applied on the two benchmarking colon

	of the high intrahepatic recurrence rate. {T}here are technological
	limitations to traditional methods such as {TNM} staging for accurate
	prediction of recurrence, suggesting that new techniques are needed.
	{METHODS}: {W}e investigated m{RNA} expression profiles in tissue
	specimens from a training set, comprising 33 patients with hepatocellular
	carcinoma, with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays representing
	about 6000 genes. {W}e used this training set in a supervised learning
	manner to construct a predictive system, consisting of 12 genes,
	with the {F}isher linear classifier. {W}e then compared the predictive
	performance of our system with that of a predictive system with a
	support vector machine ({SVM}-based system) on a blinded set of samples
	from 27 newly enrolled patients. {FINDINGS}: {E}arly intrahepatic
	recurrence within 1 year after curative surgery occurred in 12 (36\%)
	and eight (30\%) patients in the training and blinded sets, respectively.
	{O}ur system correctly predicted early intrahepatic recurrence or
	non-recurrence in 25 (93\%) of 27 samples in the blinded set and
	had a positive predictive value of 88\% and a negative predictive
	value of 95\%. {B}y contrast, the {SVM}-based system predicted early
	intrahepatic recurrence or non-recurrence correctly in only 16 (60\%)
	individuals in the blinded set, and the result yielded a positive
	predictive value of only 38\% and a negative predictive value of
	79\%. {INTERPRETATION}: {O}ur system predicted early intrahepatic
	recurrence or non-recurrence for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma
	much more accurately than the {SVM}-based system, suggesting that
	our system could serve as a new method for characterising the metastatic
	potential of hepatocellular carcinoma.},

	of improving upon currently used measures of gene expression. Our
	analyses make use of three data sets: a small experimental study
	consisting of five MGU74A mouse GeneChip arrays, part of the data
	from an extensive spike-in study conducted by Gene Logic and Wyeth's
	Genetics Institute involving 95 HG-U95A human GeneChip arrays; and
	part of a dilution study conducted by Gene Logic involving 75 HG-U95A
	GeneChip arrays. We display some familiar features of the perfect
	match and mismatch probe (PM and MM) values of these data, and examine
	the variance-mean relationship with probe-level data from probes
	believed to be defective, and so delivering noise only. We explain
	why we need to normalize the arrays to one another using probe level
	intensities. We then examine the behavior of the PM and MM using
	spike-in data and assess three commonly used summary measures: Affymetrix's
	(i) average difference (AvDiff) and (ii) MAS 5.0 signal, and (iii)
	the Li and Wong multiplicative model-based expression index (MBEI).
	The exploratory data analyses of the probe level data motivate a
	new summary measure that is a robust multi-array average (RMA) of
	background-adjusted, normalized, and log-transformed PM values. We
	evaluate the four expression summary measures using the dilution
	study data, assessing their behavior in terms of bias, variance and
	(for MBEI and RMA) model fit. Finally, we evaluate the algorithms
	in terms of their ability to detect known levels of differential
	expression using the spike-in data. We conclude that there is no
	obvious downside to using RMA and attaching a standard error (SE)
	to this quantity using a linear model which removes probe-specific
	affinities.},

	and species conservation, but also because it has implications for
	the way in which we should view heredity and evolution. In particular,
	recognizing that there are epigenetic inheritance systems through
	which non-DNA variations can be transmitted in cell and organismal
	lineages broadens the concept of heredity and challenges the widely

	binding to MHC class I molecules play an increasingly important role
	in the identification of T-cell epitopes. Statistical and machine
	learning methods in particular are widely used to score candidate
	binders based on their similarity with known binders and non-binders.
	The genes coding for the MHC molecules, however, are highly polymorphic,
	and statistical methods have difficulties building models for alleles
	with few known binders. In this context, recent work has demonstrated
	the utility of leveraging information across alleles to improve the
	performance of the prediction. RESULTS: We design a support vector
	machine algorithm that is able to learn peptide-MHC-I binding models
	for many alleles simultaneously, by sharing binding information across
	alleles. The sharing of information is controlled by a user-defined
	measure of similarity between alleles. We show that this similarity
	can be defined in terms of supertypes, or more directly by comparing
	key residues known to play a role in the peptide-MHC binding. We
	illustrate the potential of this approach on various benchmark experiments
	where it outperforms other state-of-the-art methods. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {Chemical biology approaches have a long history in the exploration
	of the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family, which represents
	the largest and most important group of targets for therapeutics.
	The analysis of the human genome revealed a significant number of
	new members with unknown physiological function which are today the
	focus of many reverse pharmacology drug-discovery programs. As the
	seven hydrophobic transmembrane segments are a defining common structural
	feature of these receptors, and as signaling through heterotrimeric
	G proteins is not demonstrated in all cases, these proteins are also
	referred to as seven transmembrane (7 TM) or serpentine receptors.
	This review summarizes important historic milestones of GPCR research,
	from the beginning, when pharmacology was mainly descriptive, to
	the age of modern molecular biology, with the cloning of the first
	receptor and now the availability of the entire human GPCR repertoire
	at the sequence and protein level. It shows how GPCR-directed drug
	discovery was initially based on the careful testing of a few specifically
	made chemical compounds and is today pursued with modern drug-discovery
	approaches, including combinatorial library design, structural biology,
	molecular informatics, and advanced screening technologies for the
	identification of new compounds that activate or inhibit GPCRs specifically.
	Such compounds, in conjunction with other new technologies, allow
	us to study the role of receptors in physiology and medicine, and
	will hopefully result in novel therapies. We also outline how basic
	research on the signaling and regulatory mechanisms of GPCRs is advancing,
	leading to the discovery of new GPCR-interacting proteins and thus
	opening new perspectives for drug development. Practical examples
	from GPCR expression studies, HTS (high-throughput screening), and
	the design of monoamine-related GPCR-focused combinatorial libraries
	illustrate ongoing GPCR chemical biology research. Finally, we outline
	future progress that may relate today's discoveries to the development
	of new medicines.},

	Stable alterations of this kind are said to be 'epigenetic', because

	of the DNA itself. Research over the past few years has focused on
	two molecular mechanisms that mediate epigenetic phenomena: DNA methylation
	and histone modifications. Here, we review advances in the understanding
	of the mechanism and role of DNA methylation in biological processes.
	Epigenetic effects by means of DNA methylation have an important
	role in development but can also arise stochastically as animals
	age. Identification of proteins that mediate these effects has provided
	insight into this complex process and diseases that occur when it
	is perturbed. External influences on epigenetic processes are seen
	in the effects of diet on long-term diseases such as cancer. Thus,
	epigenetic mechanisms seem to allow an organism to respond to the

	environmental effects can provoke epigenetic responses represents

  abstract = {An innovative bioinformatic method has been designed and implemented
	to detect similar three-dimensional (3D) sites in proteins. This
	approach allows the comparison of protein structures or substructures
	and detects local spatial similarities: this method is completely
	independent from the amino acid sequence and from the backbone structure.
	In contrast to already existing tools, the basis for this method
	is a representation of the protein structure by a set of stereochemical
	groups that are defined independently from the notion of amino acid.
	An efficient heuristic for finding similarities that uses graphs
	of triangles of chemical groups to represent the protein structures
	has been developed. The implementation of this heuristic constitutes
	a software named SuMo (Surfing the Molecules), which allows the dynamic
	definition of chemical groups, the selection of sites in the proteins,
	and the management and screening of databases. To show the relevance
	of this approach, we focused on two extreme examples illustrating
	convergent and divergent evolution. In two unrelated serine proteases,
	SuMo detects one common site, which corresponds to the catalytic
	triad. In the legume lectins family composed of >100 structures that
	share similar sequences and folds but may have lost their ability
	to bind a carbohydrate molecule, SuMo discriminates between functional
	and non-functional lectins with a selectivity of 96\%. The time needed
	for searching a given site in a protein structure is typically 0.1
	s on a PIII 800MHz/Linux computer; thus, in further studies, SuMo
	will be used to screen the PDB.},

	evaluated in 7 NB cell lines, using DNAs from G1 and S phases flow
	sorted nuclei hybridised on the same array. Strikingly, these replication
	timing profiles were highly similar between the different NB cell
	lines. Furthermore, a significant level of similarity was also observed
	between NB cell lines and lymphoblastoid cells. A segmentation analysis
	using the Adaptative Weights Smoothing procedure was performed to
	determine regions of coordinate replication. More than 50\% of the
	breakpoints mapped to early replicating regions, which account for
	23.7\% of the total genome. The breakpoints frequency per 10(8) bases

	when chromosomes 1 and 17, the two most frequent translocation partners

	the sources of variability in the gene expression profile by singular
	value decomposition which specified three major patterns of variability.
	{T}he first and the most distinct mode grouped transcripts differentiating
	between tumor and normal tissues. {T}wo consecutive modes contained
	a large proportion of immunity-related genes. {T}o generate a multigene
	classifier for tumor-normal difference, we used support vector machines-based
	technique (recursive feature replacement). {I}t included the following
	19 genes: {DPP}4, {GJB}3, {ST}14, {SERPINA}1, {LRP}4, {MET}, {EVA}1,
	{SPUVE}, {LGALS}3, {HBB}, {MKRN}2, {MRC}2, {IGSF}1, {KIAA}0830, {RXRG},
	{P}4{HA}2, {CDH}3, {IL}13{RA}1, and {MTMR}4, and correctly discriminated
	17 of 18 additional {PTC}/normal thyroid samples and all 16 samples
	published in a previous microarray study. {S}elected novel genes
	({LRP}4, {EVA}1, {TMPRSS}4, {QPCT}, and {SLC}34{A}2) were confirmed
	by {Q}-{PCR}.{O}ur results prove that the gene expression signal
	of {PTC} is easily detectable even when cancer cells do not prevail
	over tumor stroma. {W}e indicate and separate the confounding variability
	related to the immune response. {F}inally, we propose a potent molecular
	classifier able to discriminate between {PTC} and nonmalignant thyroid
	in more than 90\% of investigated samples.},

	involves an ensemble of support vector machines ({SVM}s) for classification,
	a smoothed leave-one-out ({SLOO}) cross-validation method for obtaining
	error estimates, and use of a bootstrap aggregation method for training
	and model selection. {O}ur use of an ensemble of {SVM} classifiers

	with single {SVM}s and reduce the number of false-positive detections.
	{T}he bootstrap-based model-selection technique is used for tuning
	{SVM} parameters. {I}n our first experiment, two independent data
	sets were used: the first, for feature and model selection, and the
	second, for testing to evaluate the generalizability of our model.
	{I}n the second experiment, the test set that contained higher resolution
	data was used for training and testing (using the {SLOO} method)
	to compare {SVM} committee and single {SVM} performance. {RESULTS}:
	{T}he overall sensitivity on independent test set was 75\%, with
	1.5 false-positive detections/study, compared with 76\%-78\% sensitivity

	a 1.5 times reduction compared with a single {SVM}. {CONCLUSION}:
	{T}raining an {SVM} ensemble on one data set and testing it on the

	a low false-positive rate. {T}he model selection and improved error

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: siRNAs are small RNAs that serve as sequence determinants
	during the gene silencing process called RNA interference (RNAi).
	It is well know that siRNA efficiency is crucial in the RNAi pathway,
	and the siRNA efficiency for targeting different sites of a specific
	gene varies greatly. Therefore, there is high demand for reliable
	siRNAs prediction tools and for the design methods able to pick up
	high silencing potential siRNAs. RESULTS: In this paper, two systems
	have been established for the prediction of functional siRNAs: (1)
	a statistical model based on sequence information and (2) a machine
	learning model based on three features of siRNA sequences, namely
	binary description, thermodynamic profile and nucleotide composition.
	Both of the two methods show high performance on the two datasets
	we have constructed for training the model. CONCLUSION: Both of the
	two methods studied in this paper emphasize the importance of sequence
	information for the prediction of functional siRNAs. The way of denoting
	a bio-sequence by binary system in mathematical language might be
	helpful in other analysis work associated with fixed-length bio-sequence.},

	sites on the 3' untranslated regions of human gene transcripts for
	all currently known 218 mammalian miRNAs to facilitate focused experiments.
	We report about 2,000 human genes with miRNA target sites conserved
	in mammals and about 250 human genes conserved as targets between
	mammals and fish. The prediction algorithm optimizes sequence complementarity
	using position-specific rules and relies on strict requirements of
	interspecies conservation. Experimental support for the validity
	of the method comes from known targets and from strong enrichment
	of predicted targets in mRNAs associated with the fragile X mental
	retardation protein in mammals. This is consistent with the hypothesis
	that miRNAs act as sequence-specific adaptors in the interaction
	of ribonuclear particles with translationally regulated messages.
	Overrepresented groups of targets include mRNAs coding for transcription
	factors, components of the miRNA machinery, and other proteins involved
	in translational regulation, as well as components of the ubiquitin
	machinery, representing novel feedback loops in gene regulation.
	Detailed information about target genes, target processes, and open-source

	approach to predict MHC I--peptide binding, we developed a new and
	improved structure-based model for which parameters can be estimated
	from additional sources of data about MHC-peptide binding. In addition
	to the known 3D structures of a small number of MHC-peptide complexes
	that were used in the original threading approach, we included three
	other sources of information on peptide-MHC binding: (1) MHC class
	I sequences; (2) known binding energies for a large number of MHC-peptide
	complexes; and (3) an even larger binary dataset that contains information
	about strong binders (epitopes) and non-binders (peptides that have
	a low affinity for a particular MHC molecule). Our model significantly
	outperforms the standard threading approach in binding energy prediction.
	In our approach, which we call adaptive double threading, the parameters
	of the threading model are learnable, and both MHC and peptide sequences
	can be threaded onto structures of other alleles. These two properties
	make our model appropriate for predicting binding for alleles for
	which very little data (if any) is available beyond just their sequence,
	including prediction for alleles for which 3D structures are not
	available. The ability of our model to generalize beyond the MHC
	types for which training data is available also separates our approach
	from epitope prediction methods which treat MHC alleles as symbolic
	types, rather than biological sequences. We used the trained binding
	energy predictor to study viral infections in 246 HIV patients from
	the West Australian cohort, and over 1000 sequences in HIV clade
	B from Los Alamos National Laboratory database, capturing the course
	of HIV evolution over the last 20 years. Finally, we illustrate short-,
	medium-, and long-term adaptation of HIV to the human immune system.

	25% of grade III invasive ductal breast carcinomas are associated

	subgroup. We have investigated whether this group of breast cancers
	has a distinguishing pattern of genetic alterations and which of
	these may relate to the different clinical outcome of these patients.
	We performed comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) analysis on
	43 grade III invasive ductal breast carcinomas positive for basal
	cytokeratin 14, as well as 43 grade- and age-matched CK14-negative
	controls, all with up to 25 years (median, 7 years) of clinical follow-up.
	Significant differences in CGH alterations were seen between the
	two groups in terms of mean number of changes (CK14+ve - 6.5, CK14-ve
	- 10.3; P = 0.0012) and types of alterations at chromosomes 4q, 7q,

	revealed distinct subgroups, one of which contained 18 (42%) of the
	CK14+ve tumors. This subgroup had significantly shorter overall survival
	(P = 0.0414) than other grade III tumors, regardless of CK14 status,
	and was an independent prognostic marker (P = 0.031). These data
	provide evidence that the "basal" phenotype on its own does not convey
	a poor prognosis. Basal tumors are also heterogeneous with only a
	subset, identifiable by pattern of genetic alterations, exhibiting
	a shorter overall survival. Robust characterization of this basal

  abstract = {There is tremendous ferment in the field of epigenetics as the relationships
	between chromatin structure and DNA methylation patterns become clearer.
	Central to this activity is the realization that the 'histone code',
	which involves the post-translational modification of histones and
	which has important ramifications for chromatin structure, may be
	linked to the DNA cytosine methylation pattern. New discoveries have
	suggested that histone lysine 9 methylation is implicated in the
	spread of heterochromatin in Drosophila and other organisms. Very
	recently it has been found that histone lysine 9 methylation is also
	necessary for some DNA methylation in Neurospora and plants. There
	is therefore the possibility that these two processes are closely
	linked, suggesting ways in which DNA methylation patterns may be
	established during normal development. Understanding these processes
	is fundamental to understanding what goes awry during the process
	of aging and carcinogenesis where DNA methylation patterns become
	substantially altered and contribute to the malignant phenotype.},

	Using the GLOBOCAN (2002) and Cancer Incidence in Five Continents

	age-adjusted temporal trends, and age-specific incidence patterns
	in selected geographic regions of the world. For the eight most common

	prostate, liver, cervix, and esophagus-the most important risk factors,
	cancer prevention and control measures are briefly reviewed. In 2002,
	an estimated 11 million new cancer cases and 7 million cancer deaths
	were reported worldwide; nearly 25 million persons were living with
	cancer. Among the eight most common cancers, global disparities in
	cancer incidence, mortality, and prevalence are evident, likely due
	to complex interactions of nonmodifiable (ie, genetic susceptibility
	and aging) and modifiable risk factors (ie, tobacco, infectious agents,
	diet, and physical activity). Indeed, when risk factors among populations
	are intertwined with differences in individual behaviors, cultural
	beliefs and practices, socioeconomic conditions, and health care

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Inferring networks of proteins from biological data is
	a central issue of computational biology. Most network inference
	methods, including Bayesian networks, take unsupervised approaches
	in which the network is totally unknown in the beginning, and all
	the edges have to be predicted. A more realistic supervised framework,
	proposed recently, assumes that a substantial part of the network
	is known. We propose a new kernel-based method for supervised graph
	inference based on multiple types of biological datasets such as
	gene expression, phylogenetic profiles and amino acid sequences.
	Notably, our method assigns a weight to each type of dataset and
	thereby selects informative ones. Data selection is useful for reducing
	data collection costs. For example, when a similar network inference
	problem must be solved for other organisms, the dataset excluded
	by our algorithm need not be collected. RESULTS: First, we formulate
	supervised network inference as a kernel matrix completion problem,
	where the inference of edges boils down to estimation of missing
	entries of a kernel matrix. Then, an expectation-maximization algorithm
	is proposed to simultaneously infer the missing entries of the kernel
	matrix and the weights of multiple datasets. By introducing the weights,
	we can integrate multiple datasets selectively and thereby exclude
	irrelevant and noisy datasets. Our approach is favorably tested in
	two biological networks: a metabolic network and a protein interaction
	network. AVAILABILITY: Software is available on request.},

	for coding a class of ergodic sources is given. {W}ith this method,
	a weakly universal sequence of codes is constructed for variable-rate
	noise. less coding and for fixed- and variable-rate coding with respect
	to a fidelity criterion. {I}n this way a unified approach to weak
	universal block source coding is obtained. {F}or the noiseless variable-rate
	coding and the fixed-rate coding with respect to fidelity criterion,
	the assumptions made on the alphabets, distortion measures, and class
	of sources are both necessary and sufficient. {F}or fixed-rate coding
	with respect to a fidelity criterion, the sample distortion of the
	universal code sequence converges in{L}^{l}norm for each source to
	the optimum distortion for that source. {F}or both variable-rate
	noiseless coding and variable-rate coding with respect to a fidelity
	criterion, the sample rate of the universal code sequence converges
	in{L}^{1}norm for each source to the optimum rate for that source.
	{U}sing this fact, a universal sequence of codes for fixed-rate noiseless
	coding is obtained. {S}ome applications to stationary nonergodic

  abstract = {Most of the prototype reduction schemes ({PRS}), which have been reported
	in the literature, process the data in its entirety to yield a subset
	of prototypes that are useful in nearest-neighbor-like classification.
	{F}oremost among these are the prototypes for nearest neighbor classifiers,
	the vector quantization technique, and the support vector machines.
	{T}hese methods suffer from a major disadvantage, namely, that of
	the excessive computational burden encountered by processing all
	the data. {I}n this paper, we suggest a recursive and computationally
	superior mechanism referred to as adaptive recursive partitioning
	({ARP})_{PRS}. {R}ather than process all the data using a {PRS},
	we propose that the data be recursively subdivided into smaller subsets.
	{T}his recursive subdivision can be arbitrary, and need not utilize
	any underlying clustering philosophy. {T}he advantage of {ARP}_{PRS}
	is that the {PRS} processes subsets of data points that effectively
	sample the entire space to yield smaller subsets of prototypes. {T}hese
	prototypes are then, in turn, gathered and processed by the {PRS}
	to yield more refined prototypes. {I}n this manner, prototypes which
	are in the interior of the {V}oronoi spaces, and thus ineffective
	in the classification, are eliminated at the subsequent invocations
	of the {PRS}. {W}e are unaware of any {PRS} that employs such a recursive
	philosophy. {A}lthough we marginally forfeit accuracy in return for
	computational efficiency, our experimental results demonstrate that
	the proposed recursive mechanism yields classification comparable
	to the best reported prototype condensation schemes reported to-date.
	{I}ndeed, this is true for both artificial data sets and for samples
	involving real-life data sets. {T}he results especially demonstrate
	that a fair computational advantage can be obtained by using such
	a recursive strategy for "large" data sets, such as those involved
	in data mining and text categorization applications.}

	structure is to use a relational description, where the internal

	Our atom and bond connectivities representation is a relational description.
	ILP algorithms can form SARs with relational descriptions. We have
	tested the relational approach by investigating the SARs of 230 aromatic
	and heteroaromatic nitro compounds. These compounds had been split
	previously into two subsets, 188 compounds that were amenable to
	regression and 42 that were not. For the 188 compounds, a SAR was
	found that was as accurate as the best statistical or neural network-generated
	SARs. The PROGOL SAR has the advantages that it did not need the
	use of any indicator variables handcrafted by an expert, and the
	generated rules were easily comprehensible. For the 42 compounds,
	PROGOL formed a SAR that was significantly (P < 0.025) more accurate
	than linear regression, quadratic regression, and back-propagation.

	high-throughput screening (HTS) is often complemented by rational

	screening set by ligand-based virtual screening of our corporate
	compound database. This set of compounds is supplemented with novel
	libraries synthesized around proprietary scaffolds. These target-directed
	libraries are designed using the knowledge of privileged fragments
	and pharmacophores to address specific GPCR subfamilies (e.g., purinergic
	or chemokine-binding GPCRs). Experimental testing of the GPCR collection
	has provided novel chemical series for several GPCR targets including
	the adenosine A1, the P2Y12, and the chemokine CCR1 receptor. In
	addition, GPCR sequence motifs linked to the recognition of GPCR
	ligands (termed chemoprints) are identified using homology modeling,
	molecular docking, and experimental profiling. These chemoprints

  abstract = {Structure-based design has emerged as a new tool in medicinal chemistry.
	A prerequisite for this new approach is an understanding of the principles
	of molecular recognition in protein-ligand complexes. If the three-dimensional
	structure of a given protein is known, this information can be directly
	exploited for the retrieval and design of new ligands. Structure-based
	ligand design is an iterative approach. First of all, it requires
	the crystal structure or a model derived from the crystal structure
	of a closely related homolog of the target protein, preferentially
	complexed with a ligand. This complex unravels the binding mode and
	conformation of a ligand under investigation and indicates the essential
	aspects determining its binding affinity. It is then used to generate
	new ideas about ways of improving an existing ligand or of developing
	new alternative bonding skeletons. Computational methods supplemented
	by molecular graphics are applied to assist this step of hypothesis
	generation. The features of the protein binding pocket can be translated
	into queries used for virtual computer screening of large compound
	libraries or to design novel ligands de novo. These initial proposals
	must be confirmed experimentally. Subsequently they are optimized
	toward higher affinity and better selectivity. The latter aspect
	is of utmost importance in defining and controlling the pharmacological
	profile of a ligand. A prerequisite to tailoring selectivity by rational
	design is a detailed understanding of molecular parameters determining
	selectivity. Taking examples from current drug development programs
	(HIV proteinase, t-RNA transglycosylase, thymidylate synthase, thrombin
	and, related serine proteinases), we describe recent advances in
	lead discovery via computer screening, iterative design, and understanding
	of selectivity discrimination.},

	on gene expression in normal breast fibroblasts after radiation-induced
	{DNA} damage has been investigated. {EXPERIMENTAL} {DESIGN}: {H}igh-density
	c{DNA} microarray technology was used to identify differential responses
	to {DNA} damage in fibroblasts from nine heterozygous {BRCA}1 mutation
	carriers compared with five control samples without personal or family
	history of any cancer. {F}ibroblast cultures were irradiated, and
	their expression profile was compared using intensity ratios of the

	comparison and class prediction analysis has shown that {BRCA}1 mutation
	carriers can be distinguished from controls with high probability
	(approximately 85\%). {S}ignificance analysis of microarrays and
	the support vector machine classifier identified gene sets that discriminate
	the samples according to their mutation status. {T}hese include genes
	already known to interact with {BRCA}1 such as {CDKN}1{B}, {ATR},

  abstract = {With an ever-increasing amount of available data on protein-protein
	interaction (PPI) networks and research revealing that these networks
	evolve at a modular level, discovery of conserved patterns in these
	networks becomes an important problem. Although available data on
	protein-protein interactions is currently limited, recently developed
	algorithms have been shown to convey novel biological insights through
	employment of elegant mathematical models. The main challenge in
	aligning PPI networks is to define a graph theoretical measure of
	similarity between graph structures that captures underlying biological
	phenomena accurately. In this respect, modeling of conservation and
	divergence of interactions, as well as the interpretation of resulting
	alignments, are important design parameters. In this paper, we develop
	a framework for comprehensive alignment of PPI networks, which is
	inspired by duplication/divergence models that focus on understanding
	the evolution of protein interactions. We propose a mathematical
	model that extends the concepts of match, mismatch, and gap in sequence
	alignment to that of match, mismatch, and duplication in network
	alignment and evaluates similarity between graph structures through
	a scoring function that accounts for evolutionary events. By relying
	on evolutionary models, the proposed framework facilitates interpretation
	of resulting alignments in terms of not only conservation but also
	divergence of modularity in PPI networks. Furthermore, as in the
	case of sequence alignment, our model allows flexibility in adjusting
	parameters to quantify underlying evolutionary relationships. Based
	on the proposed model, we formulate PPI network alignment as an optimization
	problem and present fast algorithms to solve this problem. Detailed
	experimental results from an implementation of the proposed framework
	show that our algorithm is able to discover conserved interaction
	patterns very effectively, in terms of both accuracies and computational
	cost.},

	a comprehensive and automated method allowing fast analysis and comparison
	of these putative binding pockets across the entire GPCR family is
	presented. The method relies on a robust alignment algorithm based
	on conservation indices, focusing on pharmacophore-like relationships
	between amino acids. Analysis of conservation patterns across the
	GPCR family and alignment to the rhodopsin X-ray structure allows
	the extraction of the amino acids lining the TM binding pocket in
	a so-called ligand binding pocket vector (LPV). In a second step,
	LPVs are translated to simple 3D receptor pharmacophore models, where
	each amino acid is represented by a single spherical pharmacophore
	feature and all atomic detail is omitted. Applications of the method
	include the assessment of selectivity issues, support of mutagenesis
	studies, and the derivation of rules for focused screening to identify
	chemical starting points in early drug discovery projects. Because
	of the coarseness of this 3D receptor pharmacophore model, however,
	meaningful scoring and ranking procedures of large sets of molecules
	are not justified. The LPV analysis of the trace amine-associated
	receptor family and its experimental validation is discussed as an
	example. The value of the 3D receptor model is demonstrated for a
	class C GPCR family, the metabotropic glutamate receptors.},

	has been defined as the investigation of classes of compounds (libraries)

	chemogenomics deals with the systematic analysis of chemical-biological
	interactions. Congeneric series of chemical analogs are probes to
	investigate their action on specific target classes, e.g., GPCRs,
	kinases, phosphodiesterases, ion channels, serine proteases, and
	others. Whereas such a strategy developed in pharmaceutical industry
	almost 20 years ago, it is now more systematically applied in the
	search for target- and subtype-specific ligands. The term "privileged
	structures" has been defined for scaffolds, such as the benzodiazepines,
	which very often produce biologically active analogs in a target
	family, in this case in the class of G-protein-coupled receptors.

	BIMAS and SYFPEITHI. To identify 85\% of the epitopes in the HIV

  year = {2008},
  volume = {9},
  pages = {427},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Structure-based computational methods are needed to help
	identify and characterize protein-protein complexes and their function.
	For individual proteins, the most successful technique is homology
	modelling. We investigate a simple extension of this technique to
	protein-protein complexes. We consider a large set of complexes of
	known structures, involving pairs of single-domain proteins. The
	complexes are compared with each other to establish their sequence
	and structural similarities and the relation between the two. Compared
	to earlier studies, a simpler dataset, a simpler structural alignment
	procedure, and an additional energy criterion are used. Next, we
	compare the Xray structures to models obtained by threading the native
	sequence onto other, homologous complexes. An elementary requirement
	for a successful energy function is to rank the native structure
	above any threaded structure. We use the DFIREbeta energy function,
	whose quality and complexity are typical of the models used today.
	Finally, we compare near-native models to distinctly non-native models.
	RESULTS: If weakly stable complexes are excluded (defined by a binding
	energy cutoff), as well as a few unusual complexes, a simple homology
	principle holds: complexes that share more than 35\% sequence identity
	share similar structures and interaction modes; this principle was
	less clearcut in earlier studies. The energy function was then tested
	for its ability to identify experimental structures among sets of
	decoys, produced by a simple threading procedure. On average, the
	experimental structure is ranked above 92\% of the alternate structures.
	Thus, discrimination of the native structure is good but not perfect.
	The discrimination of near-native structures is fair. Typically,
	a single, alternate, non-native binding mode exists that has a native-like
	energy. Some of the associated failures may correspond to genuine,
	alternate binding modes and/or native complexes that are artefacts
	of the crystal environment. In other cases, additional model filtering
	with more sophisticated tools is needed. CONCLUSION: The results
	suggest that the simple modelling procedure applied here could help
	identify and characterize protein-protein complexes. The next step
	is to apply it on a genomic scale.},

	and allowed us to establish a threshold mechanism of life and death.
	Here, we further assessed the predictability of the model experimentally
	by a detailed analysis of the threshold behavior of CD95 signaling.
	Using the model predictions for the mechanism of the threshold behavior
	we found that the CD95 DISC (death-inducing signaling complex) is
	formed at the cell membrane upon stimulation with low concentrations
	of agonistic anti-APO-1 monoclonal antibodies; however, activation
	of procaspase-8 at the DISC is blocked due to high cellular FLICE-inhibitory
	protein recruitment into the DISC. Given that death signaling does
	not occur upon CD95 stimulation at low (threshold) anti-APO-1 concentrations,
	we also analyzed survival signaling, focusing on mitogen-activated
	protein kinase activation. Interestingly, we found that mitogen-activated
	protein kinase activation takes place under threshold conditions.
	These findings show that triggering of CD95 can signal both life

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In recent years, a major increase in the occurrence of
	drug resistant falciparum malaria has been reported. Choline analogs,
	such as the bisthiazolium T4, represent a novel class of compounds
	with strong potency against drug sensitive and resistant P. falciparum
	clones. Although T4 and its analogs are presumed to target the parasite's
	lipid metabolism, their exact mechanism of action remains unknown.
	Here we have employed transcriptome and proteome profiling analyses
	to characterize the global response of P. falciparum to T4 during
	the intraerythrocytic cycle of this parasite. RESULTS: No significant
	transcriptional changes were detected immediately after addition
	of T4 despite the drug's effect on the parasite metabolism. Using
	the Ontology-based Pattern Identification (OPI) algorithm with an
	increased T4 incubation time, we demonstrated cell cycle arrest and
	a general induction of genes involved in gametocytogenesis. Proteomic
	analysis revealed a significant decrease in the level of the choline/ethanolamine-phosphotransferase
	(PfCEPT), a key enzyme involved in the final step of synthesis of
	phosphatidylcholine (PC). This effect was further supported by metabolic
	studies, which showed a major alteration in the synthesis of PC from
	choline and ethanolamine by the compound. CONCLUSION: Our studies
	demonstrate that the bisthiazolium compound T4 inhibits the pathways
	of synthesis of phosphatidylcholine from choline and ethanolamine
	in P. falciparum, and provide evidence for post-transcriptional regulations
	of parasite metabolism in response to external stimuli.},

  abstract = {The intrinsic, or mitochondrial, pathway of caspase activation is
	essential for apoptosis induction by various stimuli including cytotoxic
	stress. It depends on the cellular context, whether cytochrome c
	released from mitochondria induces caspase activation gradually or
	in an all-or-none fashion, and whether caspase activation irreversibly
	commits cells to apoptosis. By analyzing a quantitative kinetic model,
	we show that inhibition of caspase-3 (Casp3) and Casp9 by inhibitors
	of apoptosis (IAPs) results in an implicit positive feedback, since
	cleaved Casp3 augments its own activation by sequestering IAPs away
	from Casp9. We demonstrate that this positive feedback brings about
	bistability (i.e., all-or-none behaviour), and that it cooperates
	with Casp3-mediated feedback cleavage of Casp9 to generate irreversibility
	in caspase activation. Our calculations also unravel how cell-specific
	protein expression brings about the observed qualitative differences
	in caspase activation (gradual versus all-or-none and reversible
	versus irreversible). Finally, known regulators of the pathway are
	shown to efficiently shift the apoptotic threshold stimulus, suggesting
	that the bistable caspase cascade computes multiple inputs into an
	all-or-none caspase output. As cellular inhibitory proteins (e.g.,
	IAPs) frequently inhibit consecutive intermediates in cellular signaling
	cascades (e.g., Casp3 and Casp9), the feedback mechanism described
	in this paper is likely to be a widespread principle on how cells
	achieve ultrasensitivity, bistability, and irreversibility.},

	changes from the second edition [E. L. Lehmann, Testing statistical
	hypotheses, Second edition, Wiley, New York, 1986; MR0852406 (87j:62001)].
	``The present volume is divided into two parts. Part I (Chapters
	1--10) treats small-sample theory, while Part II (Chapters 11--15)
	treats large-sample theory. The preface to the second edition stated
	that `the most important omission is an adequate treatment of optimality
	paralleling that given for estimation in the companion volume [E.
	L. Lehmann and G. Casella, Theory of point estimation, Second edition,
	Springer, New York, 1998; MR1639875 (99g:62025)]'. We here remedy
	this failure by treating the difficult topic of asymptotic optimality
	(in Chapter 13) together with the large-sample tools needed for this
	purpose (in Chapters 11 and 12). Having developed these tools, we
	use them in Chapter 14 to give a much fuller treatment of tests of
	goodness of fit than was possible in the second edition, and in Chapter
	15 to provide an introduction to the bootstrap and related techniques.
	Various large-sample considerations that in the second edition were
	discussed in earlier chapters now have been moved to Chapter 11.
	``Another major addition is a more comprehensive treatment of multiple
	testing including some recent optimality results. This topic is now
	presented in Chapter 9. In order to make room for these extensive
	additions, we had to eliminate some material found in the second
	edition, primarily the coverage of the multivariate linear hypothesis.
	``Except for some of the basic results from Part I, a detailed knowledge
	of small-sample theory is not required for Part II. In particular,
	the necessary background should include: Chapter 3, Sections 3.1--3.5,
	3.8--3.9; Chapter 4: Sections 4.1--4.4; Chapter 5, Sections 5.1--5.3;

  abstract = {Motivation: {C}lassification of proteins sequences into functional
	and structural families based on sequence homology is a central problem
	in computational biology. {D}iscriminative supervised machine learning
	approaches provide good performance, but simplicity and computational
	efficiency of training and prediction are also important concerns.
	{R}esults: {W}e introduce a class of string kernels, called mismatch
	kernels, for use with support vector machines ({SVM}s) in a discriminative
	approach to the problem of protein classification and remote homology
	detection. {T}hese kernels measure sequence similarity based on shared
	occurrences of fixed-length patterns in the data, allowing for mutations
	between patterns. {T}hus, the kernels provide a biologically well-motivated
	way to compare protein sequences without relying on family-based
	generative models such as hidden {M}arkov models. {W}e compute the
	kernels efficiently using a mismatch tree data structure, allowing
	us to calculate the contributions of all patterns occurring in the
	data in one pass while traversing the tree. {W}hen used with an {SVM},
	the kernels enable fast prediction on test sequences. {W}e report
	experiments on two benchmark {SCOP} datasets, where we show that
	the mismatch kernel used with an {SVM} classifier performs competitively
	with state-of-the-art methods for homology detection, particularly
	when very few training examples are available. {E}xamination of the
	highest-weighted patterns learned by the {SVM} classifier recovers
	biologically important motifs in protein families and superfamilies.

  abstract = {Background {T}he increasing number of protein sequences and 3{D} structure
	obtained from genomic initiatives is leading many of us to focus
	on proteomics, and to dedicate our experimental and computational
	efforts on the creation and analysis of information derived from
	3{D} structure. {I}n particular, the high-throughput generation of
	protein-protein interaction data from a few organisms makes such
	an approach very important towards understanding the molecular recognition
	that make-up the entire protein-protein interaction network. {S}ince
	the generation of sequences, and experimental protein-protein interactions
	increases faster than the 3{D} structure determination of protein
	complexes, there is tremendous interest in developing in silico methods
	that generate such structure for prediction and classification purposes.
	{I}n this study we focused on classifying protein family members
	based on their protein-protein interaction distinctiveness. {S}tructure-based
	classification of protein-protein interfaces has been described initially
	by {P}onstingl et al. [1] and more recently by {V}aldar et al. [2]
	and {M}intseris et al. [3], from complex structures that have been
	solved experimentally. {H}owever, little has been done on protein
	classification based on the prediction of protein-protein complexes
	obtained from homology modeling and docking simulation. {R}esults
	{W}e have developed an in silico classification system entitled {HODOCO}
	({H}omology modeling, {D}ocking and {C}lassification {O}racle), in
	which protein {R}esidue {P}otential {I}nteraction {P}rofiles ({RPIPS})
	are used to summarize protein-protein interaction characteristics.
	{T}his system applied to a dataset of 64 proteins of the death domain
	superfamily was used to classify each member into its proper subfamily.
	{T}wo classification methods were attempted, heuristic and support
	vector machine learning. {B}oth methods were tested with a 5-fold
	cross-validation. {T}he heuristic approach yielded a 61% average

	experimentally. {W}hile our classification scheme does not take directly

	this paper, we provide a unified model to address both these aspects
	of natural texture. The main idea is to construct a vocabulary of
	prototype tiny surface patches with associated local geometric and
	photometric properties. We call these 3D textons. Examples might
	be ridges, grooves, spots or stripes or combinations thereof. Associated
	with each texton is an appearance vector, which characterizes the
	local irradiance distribution, represented as a set of linear Gaussian
	derivative filter outputs, under different lighting and viewing conditions.
	
	
	Given a large collection of images of different materials, a clustering
	approach is used to acquire a small (on the order of 100) 3D texton
	vocabulary. Given a few (1 to 4) images of any material, it can be
	characterized using these textons. We demonstrate the application
	of this representation for recognition of the material viewed under
	novel lighting and viewing conditions. We also illustrate how the

  abstract = {Summary: {T}his paper studies the problem of building multiclass classifiers
	for tissue classification based on gene expression. {T}he recent
	development of microarray technologies has enabled biologists to
	quantify gene expression of tens of thousands of genes in a single
	experiment. {B}iologists have begun collecting gene expression for
	a large number of samples. {O}ne of the urgent issues in the use
	of microarray data is to develop methods for characterizing samples
	based on their gene expression. {T}he most basic step in the research
	direction is binary sample classification, which has been studied
	extensively over the past few years. {T}his paper investigates the
	next step--multiclass classification of samples based on gene expression.
	{T}he characteristics of expression data (e.g. large number of genes
	with small sample size) makes the classification problem more challenging.
	{T}he process of building multiclass classifiers is divided into
	two components: (i) selection of the features (i.e. genes) to be
	used for training and testing and (ii) selection of the classification
	method. {T}his paper compares various feature selection methods as
	well as various state-of-the-art classification methods on various
	multiclass gene expression datasets. {O}ur study indicates that multiclass
	classification problem is much more difficult than the binary one
	for the gene expression datasets. {T}he difficulty lies in the fact
	that the data are of high dimensionality and that the sample size
	is small. {T}he classification accuracy appears to degrade very rapidly
	as the number of classes increases. {I}n particular, the accuracy
	was very low regardless of the choices of the methods for large-class
	datasets (e.g. {NCI}60 and {GCM}). {W}hile increasing the number
	of samples is a plausible solution to the problem of accuracy degradation,
	it is important to develop algorithms that are able to analyze effectively
	multiple-class expression data for these special datasets.},

	The key feature of this problem is that there is no labeled negative

	regulate gene expression in plants and animals. To investigate the
	influence of miRNAs on transcript levels, we transfected miRNAs into
	human cells and used microarrays to examine changes in the messenger
	RNA profile. Here we show that delivering miR-124 causes the expression
	profile to shift towards that of brain, the organ in which miR-124
	is preferentially expressed, whereas delivering miR-1 shifts the
	profile towards that of muscle, where miR-1 is preferentially expressed.
	In each case, about 100 messages were downregulated after 12 h. The
	3' untranslated regions of these messages had a significant propensity
	to pair to the 5' region of the miRNA, as expected if many of these
	messages are the direct targets of the miRNAs. Our results suggest
	that metazoan miRNAs can reduce the levels of many of their target
	transcripts, not just the amount of protein deriving from these transcripts.
	Moreover, miR-1 and miR-124, and presumably other tissue-specific
	miRNAs, seem to downregulate a far greater number of targets than
	previously appreciated, thereby helping to define tissue-specific
	gene expression in humans.},

	GPCRs but that are called 'orphans' because they are activated by
	none of the primary messengers known to activate GPCRs in vivo. They
	are the targets of undiscovered transmitters and this lack of knowledge

	in understanding the function of orphan GPCRs is to 'deorphanize'
	them, to identify their natural transmitters. Here we review the
	search for the natural primary messengers of orphan GPCRs and focus
	on two recently deorphanized GPCR systems, the melanin-concentrating

	Biased SVMs
	
	Label known positive examples (P) +1 and unlabeled examples (U) -1.
	
	Discriminate between P and U, allowing misclassification for unlabeled
	examples.
	
	In a noiseless version, positive misclassifications are not allowed.
	To account for noise, errors on P might allowed but to a smaller
	extent than errors on U. Namely, positive errors are weighted by
	C+ whereas negative errors are weighted by C-, and C+ >> C-. These
	weights should be learned thanks to a separate validation set.
	
	
	Empirical evaluation
	
	2 datasets : Reuters (10 categories) and Usenet articles (20 newsgroups).
	
	They combine every step 1 technique with every step 2 technique and
	report macroaveraged F scores (like our global average performance
	on TFs).
	
	The data set is divided into a validation set (30%) and a training
	set. The validation set is used with the criterion described above
	to select parameters C+ and C-. Then F score is computed on the training
	set.
	
	Simulation of different level of knowledge by including in the training
	set a proportion gamma of positives in the unlabeled set (gamma =
	from 10% to 90%).
	
	For gamma = 0.3 and 0.7, biased SVM outperforms PEBL, S-EM, Roc-SVM

	{G}abor wavelets first derive desirable facial features characterized

	to cope with the variations due to illumination and facial expression

	{A} fractional power polynomial, however, does not necessarily define
	a kernel function, as it might not define a positive semidefinite
	{G}ram matrix. {N}ote that the sigmoid kernels, one of the three
	classes of widely used kernel functions (polynomial kernels, {G}aussian
	kernels, and sigmoid kernels), do not actually define a positive
	semidefinite {G}ram matrix either. {N}evertheless, the sigmoid kernels
	have been successfully used in practice, such as in building support
	vector machines. {I}n order to derive real kernel {PCA} features,
	we apply only those kernel {PCA} eigenvectors that are associated
	with positive eigenvalues. {T}he feasibility of the {G}abor-based
	kernel {PCA} method with fractional power polynomial models has been

	and then analyzed with artificial neural network algorithm ({ANN});
	and the diagnostic model of cerebrospinal protein profiles for differentiating

	hormone therapies, including tamoxifen, and is a major problem in
	the treatment of breast cancer. Understanding the mechanisms involved
	in the development of antiestrogen resistance is an important step
	in the development of new targeted therapies. Two forms of antiestrogen
	resistance exist: de novo resistance and acquired resistance. To
	mimic acquired resistance, we have established a tamoxifen-resistant
	breast cancer cell line (MCF-7TamR) by treating parental MCF-7 cells
	with tamoxifen over a period of 6 months to select for cells with
	the resistant phenotype. Characterization of the MCF-7TamR cells
	under normal, hormone-deprived, and tamoxifen-treated conditions
	suggests that these cells continue to grow in the presence of tamoxifen.
	Additionally, a greater percentage of resistant cells enter the S
	phase under tamoxifen conditions, compared with parental MCF-7 cells.
	Consistent with these growth results, molecular analysis indicates
	that tamoxifen-resistant cells express higher levels of cyclin E1,
	cdk2, ACTR, and E2F1. Faslodex or ICI 182, 780 (ICI)-mediated degradation
	of estrogen receptor (ER) reduced the proliferation of these cells,
	as well as the level of E2F1 expression in tamoxifen-resistant cells,
	suggesting that tamoxifen resistance and E2F1 expression are in part
	dependent on ER. We further showed that tamoxifen enhances the ERalpha/Sp-1
	interaction and promotes the recruitment of ERalpha and Sp-1 to the
	proximal promoter of E2F1 in resistant cells. Collectively, our findings
	suggest that tamoxifen resistance is a result of increased ERalpha/Sp-1
	interaction, which enhances the expression of E2F1 to promote tamoxifen
	resistance.},

  abstract = {The most widely used statistical methods for finding differentially
	expressed genes (DEGs) are essentially univariate. In this study,
	we present a new T(2) statistic for analyzing microarray data. We
	implemented our method using a multiple forward search (MFS) algorithm
	that is designed for selecting a subset of feature vectors in high-dimensional
	microarray datasets. The proposed T2 statistic is a corollary to
	that originally developed for multivariate analyses and possesses
	two prominent statistical properties. First, our method takes into
	account multidimensional structure of microarray data. The utilization
	of the information hidden in gene interactions allows for finding
	genes whose differential expressions are not marginally detectable
	in univariate testing methods. Second, the statistic has a close
	relationship to discriminant analyses for classification of gene
	expression patterns. Our search algorithm sequentially maximizes
	gene expression difference/distance between two groups of genes.
	Including such a set of DEGs into initial feature variables may increase
	the power of classification rules. We validated our method by using
	a spike-in HGU95 dataset from Affymetrix. The utility of the new
	method was demonstrated by application to the analyses of gene expression
	patterns in human liver cancers and breast cancers. Extensive bioinformatics
	analyses and cross-validation of DEGs identified in the application
	datasets showed the significant advantages of our new algorithm.},

	mutated (ATM), a protein kinase that activates p53 once it is phosphorylated
	by DNA damage. The ATM-sensing module switches on or off the downstream
	p53 oscillator, consisting of a feedback loop formed by p53 and its
	negative regulator, Mdm2. In agreement with experiments, our simulations
	show that by assuming stochasticity in the initial number of DSBs
	and the DNA repair process, p53 and Mdm2 exhibit a coordinated oscillatory
	dynamics upon IR stimulation in single cells, with a stochastic number
	of oscillations whose mean increases with IR dose. The damped oscillations
	previously observed in cell populations can be explained as the aggregate
	behavior of single cells.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In cancer studies, it is common that multiple microarray
	experiments are conducted to measure the same clinical outcome and
	expressions of the same set of genes. An important goal of such experiments
	is to identify a subset of genes that can potentially serve as predictive
	markers for cancer development and progression. Analyses of individual
	experiments may lead to unreliable gene selection results because
	of the small sample sizes. Meta analysis can be used to pool multiple
	experiments, increase statistical power, and achieve more reliable
	gene selection. The meta analysis of cancer microarray data is challenging
	because of the high dimensionality of gene expressions and the differences
	in experimental settings amongst different experiments. RESULTS:
	We propose a Meta Threshold Gradient Descent Regularization (MTGDR)
	approach for gene selection in the meta analysis of cancer microarray
	data. The MTGDR has many advantages over existing approaches. It
	allows different experiments to have different experimental settings.
	It can account for the joint effects of multiple genes on cancer,
	and it can select the same set of cancer-associated genes across
	multiple experiments. Simulation studies and analyses of multiple
	pancreatic and liver cancer experiments demonstrate the superior
	performance of the MTGDR. CONCLUSION: The MTGDR provides an effective
	way of analyzing multiple cancer microarray studies and selecting
	reliable cancer-associated genes.},

  abstract = {Commensal and pathogenic strains of Escherichia coli possess three
	inducible acid resistance systems that collaboratively protect cells
	against acid stress to pH 2 or below. The most effective system requires
	glutamate in the acid challenge media and relies on two glutamate
	decarboxylases (GadA and B) combined with a putative glutamate:gamma-aminobutyric
	acid antiporter (GadC). A complex network of regulators mediates
	induction of this system in response to various media, pH and growth
	phase signals. We report that the LuxR-like regulator GadE (formerly
	YhiE) is required for expression of gadA and gadBC regardless of
	media or growth conditions. This protein binds directly to the 20
	bp GAD box sequence found in the control regions of both loci. Two
	previously identified AraC-like regulators, GadX and GadW, are only
	needed for gadA/BC expression under some circumstances. Overexpression
	of GadX or GadW will not overcome a need for GadE. However, overexpression
	of GadE can supplant a requirement for GadX and W. Data provided
	also indicate that GadX and GadE can simultaneously bind the area
	around the GAD box region and probably form a complex. The gadA,
	gadBC and gadE genes are all induced by low pH in exponential phase
	cells grown in minimal glucose media. The acid induction of gadA/BC
	results primarily from the acid induction of gadE. Constitutive expression
	of GadE removes most pH control over the glutamate decarboxylase
	and antiporter genes. The small amount of remaining pH control is
	governed by GadX and W. The finding that gadE mutations also diminish
	the effectiveness of the other two acid resistance systems suggests
	that GadE influences the expression of additional acid resistance
	components. The number of regulatory proteins (five), sigma factors
	(two) and regulatory feedback loops focused on gadA/BC expression
	make this one of the most intensively regulated systems in E. coli.},

	the use of the theory of relevance vector machine ({RVM}), a recent
	{B}ayesian machine-learning framework of statistical pattern recognition,
	for development of a fully probabilistic algorithm for autofluorescence
	diagnosis of early stage cancer of human oral cavity. {I}t also presents
	a comparative evaluation of the diagnostic efficacy of the {RVM}
	algorithm with that based on support vector machine ({SVM}) that
	has recently received considerable attention for this purpose. {STUDY}
	{DESIGN}/{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: {T}he diagnostic algorithms
	were developed using in vivo autofluorescence spectral data acquired
	from human oral cavity with a {N}(2) laser-based portable fluorimeter.
	{T}he spectral data of both patients as well as normal volunteers,
	enrolled at {O}ut {P}atient department of the {G}ovt. {C}ancer {H}ospital,
	{I}ndore for screening of oral cavity, were used for this purpose.
	{T}he patients selected had no prior confirmed malignancy and were
	diagnosed of squamous cell carcinoma ({SCC}), {G}rade-{I} on the
	basis of histopathology of biopsy taken from abnormal site subsequent
	to acquisition of spectra. {A}utofluorescence spectra were recorded
	from a total of 171 tissue sites from 16 patients and 154 healthy
	squamous tissue sites from 13 normal volunteers. {O}f 171 tissues
	sites from patients, 83 were {SCC} and the rest were contralateral
	uninvolved squamous tissue. {E}ach site was treated separately and
	classified via the diagnostic algorithm developed. {I}nstead of the
	spectral data from uninvolved sites of patients, the data from normal
	volunteers were used as the normal database for the development of
	diagnostic algorithms. {RESULTS}: {T}he diagnostic algorithms based
	on {RVM} were found to provide classification performance comparable
	to the state-of-the-art {SVM}s, while at the same time explicitly
	predicting the probability of class membership. {T}he sensitivity
	and specificity towards cancer were up to 88\% and 95\% for the training
	set data based on leave- one-out cross validation and up to 91\%
	and 96\% for the validation set data. {W}hen implemented on the spectral
	data of the uninvolved oral cavity sites from the patients, it yielded
	a specificity of up to 91\%. {CONCLUSIONS}: {T}he {B}ayesian framework
	of {RVM} formulation makes it possible to predict the posterior probability
	of class membership in discriminating early {SCC} from the normal
	squamous tissue sites of the oral cavity in contrast to dichotomous
	classification provided by the non-{B}ayesian {SVM}. {S}uch classification
	is very helpful in handling asymmetric misclassification costs like
	assigning different weights for having a false negative result for
	identifying cancer compared to false positive. {T}he results further
	demonstrate that for comparable diagnostic performances, the {RVM}-based
	algorithms use significantly fewer kernel functions and do not need
	to estimate any hoc parameters associated with the learning or the
	optimization technique to be used. {T}his implies a considerable
	saving in memory and computation in a practical implementation.},

	decomposes any signal into a linear expansion of waveforms that are

	pursuits are general procedures to compute adaptive signal representations.
	With a dictionary of Gabor functions a matching pursuit defines an
	adaptive time-frequency transform. They derive a signal energy distribution
	in the time-frequency plane, which does not include interference
	terms, unlike Wigner and Cohen class distributions. A matching pursuit
	isolates the signal structures that are coherent with respect to
	a given dictionary. An application to pattern extraction from noisy
	signals is described. They compare a matching pursuit decomposition

	of this paper is twofold: First, we propose to apply supervised learning
	of hidden Markov models (HMMs) to this problem, which can surpass
	existing methods for the problem of predicting MHC-binding peptides.
	Second, we generate peptides that have high probabilities to bind
	to a certain MHC molecule, based on our proposed method using peptides
	binding to MHC molecules as a set of training data. From our experiments,
	in a type of cross-validation test, the discrimination accuracy of
	our supervised learning method is usually approximately 2-15\% better
	than those of other methods, including backpropagation neural networks,
	which have been regarded as the most effective approach to this problem.
	Furthermore, using an HMM trained for HLA-A2, we present new peptide
	sequences that are provided with high binding probabilities by the
	HMM and that are thus expected to bind to HLA-A2 proteins. Peptide
	sequences not shown in this paper but with rather high binding probabilities

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Elucidating gene regulatory networks is crucial for understanding
	normal cell physiology and complex pathologic phenotypes. Existing
	computational methods for the genome-wide "reverse engineering" of
	such networks have been successful only for lower eukaryotes with
	simple genomes. Here we present ARACNE, a novel algorithm, using
	microarray expression profiles, specifically designed to scale up
	to the complexity of regulatory networks in mammalian cells, yet
	general enough to address a wider range of network deconvolution
	problems. This method uses an information theoretic approach to eliminate
	the majority of indirect interactions inferred by co-expression methods.
	RESULTS: We prove that ARACNE reconstructs the network exactly (asymptotically)
	if the effect of loops in the network topology is negligible, and
	we show that the algorithm works well in practice, even in the presence
	of numerous loops and complex topologies. We assess ARACNE's ability
	to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks using both a realistic
	synthetic dataset and a microarray dataset from human B cells. On
	synthetic datasets ARACNE achieves very low error rates and outperforms
	established methods, such as Relevance Networks and Bayesian Networks.
	Application to the deconvolution of genetic networks in human B cells
	demonstrates ARACNE's ability to infer validated transcriptional
	targets of the cMYC proto-oncogene. We also study the effects of
	misestimation of mutual information on network reconstruction, and
	show that algorithms based on mutual information ranking are more
	resilient to estimation errors. CONCLUSION: ARACNE shows promise
	in identifying direct transcriptional interactions in mammalian cellular
	networks, a problem that has challenged existing reverse engineering
	algorithms. This approach should enhance our ability to use microarray
	data to elucidate functional mechanisms that underlie cellular processes
	and to identify molecular targets of pharmacological compounds in
	mammalian cellular networks.},

  abstract = {A new 4-point pharmacophore method for molecular similarity and diversity
	that rapidly calculates all potential pharmacophores/pharmacophoric
	shapes for a molecule or a protein site is described. The method,
	an extension to the ChemDiverse/Chem-X software (Oxford Molecular,
	Oxford, England), has also been customized to enable a new internally
	referenced measure of pharmacophore diversity. The "privileged" substructure
	concept for the design of high-affinity ligands is presented, and
	an example of this new method is described for the design of combinatorial
	libraries for 7-transmembrane G-protein-coupled receptor targets,
	where "privileged" substructures are used as special features to
	internally reference the pharmacophoric shapes. Up to 7 features
	and 15 distance ranges are considered, giving up to 350 million potential
	4-point 3D pharmacophores/molecule. The resultant pharmacophore "key"
	("fingerprint") serves as a powerful measure for diversity or similarity,
	calculable for both a ligand and a protein site, and provides a consistent
	frame of reference for comparing molecules, sets of molecules, and
	protein sites. Explicit "on-the-fly" conformational sampling is performed
	for a molecule to enable the calculation of all geometries accessible
	for all combinations of four features (i.e., 4-point pharmacophores)
	at any desired sampling resolution. For a protein site, complementary
	site points to groups displayed in the site are generated and all
	combinations of four site points are considered. In this paper we
	report (i) the details of our customized implementation of the method
	and its modification to systematically measure 4-point pharmacophores
	relative to a "special" substructure of interest present in the molecules
	under study; (ii) comparisons of 3- and 4-point pharmacophore methods,

	algorithms. {U}sing prior knowledge, these algorithms can assign
	functional annotations based on more complex expression signatures
	found in existing functional classes. {P}reviously, support vector
	machines ({SVM}s) and other machine-learning methods have been applied
	to a limited number of functional classes for this purpose. {H}ere
	we present, for the first time, the comprehensive application of
	supervised neural networks ({SNN}s) for functional annotation. {O}ur
	study is novel in that we report systematic results for ~100 classes

	that the high degree of interconnections among functional classes
	confounds the signatures that ought to be learned for a unique class.
	{W}e term this the "{B}orges effect" and introduce two new numerical
	indices for its quantification. {O}ur analysis indicates that classification
	systems with a lower {B}orges effect are better suitable for machine
	learning. {F}urthermore, we introduce a learning procedure for combining
	false positives with the original class. {W}e show that in a few
	iterations this process converges to a gene set that is learnable
	with considerably low rates of false positives and negatives and
	contains genes that are biologically related to the original class,
	allowing for a coarse reconstruction of the interactions between
	associated biological pathways. {W}e exemplify this methodology using

	on a 2D description using a binary fingerprint, which accounts for
	the absence or presence of molecular fragments, or a 3D description
	based on the geometry of pharmacophoric features encoded in a fingerprint
	(pharmacophoric definition triplets, PDTs). Both descriptors in combination
	with maximum dissimilarity selections, complete linkage hierarchical
	cluster analysis, or sequential dissimilarity selections were compared
	to random subsets as reference. This comparison is based on their
	ability to cover representative biological classes from parent databases
	(coverage analysis) and the degree of separation between active and
	inactive compounds for a biological target from hierarchical clustering
	(cluster separation analysis). While the similarity coefficients
	(Tanimoto, cosine) show only a minor influence, the number of conformations
	to generate the 3D PDT fingerprint lead to remarkably different results.
	PDT fingerprints derived from a lower number of conformers perform
	significantly better, but they are not comparable to a 2D fingerprint-based
	design. When 2D and 3D descriptors are combined with weighting factors
	> 0.5 for 2D fingerprints, a significant improvement of coverage
	and cluster separation results is observed for a small number of
	PDT conformers and medium sized subsets. Some combined descriptors
	outperform 2D fingerprints, but not for all subset populations. Applying
	sequential dissimilarity selection to PDT descriptors reveals that
	its performance is dependent on the initial ordering of compounds,
	while presorting according to 2D fingerprint diversity does not improve
	results. Finally the relationship between biological activity and
	similarity was investigated, showing that PDTs quantify smaller structural
	differences due to the large number of bits in the fingerprint.},

	carcinomatosa, p{T}4 category, percentage of tumour cells in {G}2/{M}-
	and {S}-phases of the cell cycle, and ploidy index were considered

	{T}hree paradigms with supervised learning rules (multilayer perceptron,

  abstract = {Background {K}ernel-based learning algorithms are among the most advanced
	machine learning methods and have been successfully applied to a
	variety of sequence classification tasks within the field of bioinformatics.
	{C}onventional kernels utilized so far do not provide an easy interpretation
	of the learnt representations in terms of positional and compositional
	variability of the underlying biological signals. {R}esults {W}e
	propose a kernel-based approach to datamining on biological sequences.
	{W}ith our method it is possible to model and analyze positional
	variability of oligomers of any length in a natural way. {O}n one
	hand this is achieved by mapping the sequences to an intuitive but
	high-dimensional feature space, well-suited for interpretation of
	the learnt models. {O}n the other hand, by means of the kernel trick
	we can provide a general learning algorithm for that high-dimensional
	representation because all required statistics can be computed without
	performing an explicit feature space mapping of the sequences. {B}y
	introducing a kernel parameter that controls the degree of position-dependency,
	our feature space representation can be tailored to the characteristics
	of the biological problem at hand. {A} regularized learning scheme
	enables application even to biological problems for which only small
	sets of example sequences are available. {O}ur approach includes
	a visualization method for transparent representation of characteristic
	sequence features. {T}hereby importance of features can be measured
	in terms of discriminative strength with respect to classification
	of the underlying sequences. {T}o demonstrate and validate our concept
	on a biochemically well-defined case, we analyze {E}. coli translation
	initiation sites in order to show that we can find biologically relevant
	signals. {F}or that case, our results clearly show that the {S}hine-{D}algarno
	sequence is the most important signal upstream a start codon. {T}he
	variability in position and composition we found for that signal
	is in accordance with previous biological knowledge. {W}e also find
	evidence for signals downstream of the start codon, previously introduced
	as transcriptional enhancers. {T}hese signals are mainly characterized
	by occurrences of adenine in a region of about 4 nucleotides next
	to the start codon. {C}onclusions {W}e showed that the oligo kernel
	can provide a valuable tool for the analysis of relevant signals
	in biological sequences. {I}n the case of translation initiation
	sites we could clearly deduce the most discriminative motifs and
	their positional variation from example sequences. {A}ttractive features
	of our approach are its flexibility with respect to oligomer length
	and position conservation. {B}y means of these two parameters oligo
	kernels can easily be adapted to different biological problems.},

	modelling or cluster analysis is notoriously difficult, especially
	for high-dimensional data. We introduce stability selection. It is
	based on subsampling in combination with (high-dimensional) selection
	algorithms. As such, the method is extremely general and has a very
	wide range of applicability. Stability selection provides finite
	sample control for some error rates of false discoveries and hence
	a transparent principle to choose a proper amount of regularisation
	for structure estimation. Variable selection and structure estimation
	improve markedly for a range of selection methods if stability selection
	is applied. We prove for randomised Lasso that stability selection
	will be variable selection consistent even if the necessary conditions

	selection estimates the conditional independence restrictions separately
	for each node in the graph and is hence equivalent to variable selection
	for Gaussian linear models. We show that the proposed neighborhood
	selection scheme is consistent for sparse high-dimensional graphs.
	Consistency hinges on the choice of the penalty parameter. The oracle
	value for optimal prediction does not lead to a consistent neighborhood
	estimate. Controlling instead the probability of falsely joining

	for sparse graphs is achieved (with exponential rates), even when

	the development of numerous network models intending to describe

	most cases the success of a model has been evaluated by how well
	it reproduces a few key features of the real-world data, such as

	{O}ften pairs of models can reproduce these features with indistinguishable
	fidelity despite being generated by vastly different mechanisms.
	{I}n such cases, these few target features are insufficient to distinguish
	which of the different models best describes real world networks
	of interest; moreover, it is not clear a priori that any of the presently-existing
	algorithms for network generation offers a predictive description
	of the networks inspiring them. {RESULTS}: {W}e present a method
	to assess systematically which of a set of proposed network generation
	algorithms gives the most accurate description of a given biological
	network. {T}o derive discriminative classifiers, we construct a mapping
	from the set of all graphs to a high-dimensional (in principle infinite-dimensional)

	for which no biochemical characterization is available. The analysis
	of protein structure and function assignment is becoming an unexpected
	challenge and a major bottleneck towards the goal of well-annotated
	genomes. As shape plays a crucial role in biomolecular recognition
	and function, the examination and development of shape description
	and comparison techniques is likely to be of prime importance for
	understanding protein structure-function relationships. RESULTS:
	A novel technique is presented for the comparison of protein binding
	pockets. The method uses the coefficients of a real spherical harmonics
	expansion to describe the shape of a protein's binding pocket. Shape
	similarity is computed as the L2 distance in coefficient space. Such
	comparisons in several thousands per second can be carried out on
	a standard linux PC. Other properties such as the electrostatic potential
	fit seamlessly into the same framework. The method can also be used
	directly for describing the shape of proteins and other molecules.
	AVAILABILITY: A limited version of the software for the real spherical
	harmonics expansion of a set of points in PDB format is freely available
	upon request from the authors. Binding pocket comparisons and ligand
	prediction will be made available through the protein structure annotation
	pipeline Profunc (written by Roman Laskowski) which will be accessible

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Current computational methods for the prediction of function
	from structure are restricted to the detection of similarities and
	subsequent transfer of functional annotation. In a significant minority
	of cases, global sequence or structural (fold) similarities do not
	provide clues about protein function. In these cases, one alternative
	is to detect local binding site similarities. These may still reflect
	more distant evolutionary relationships as well as unique physico-chemical
	constraints necessary for binding similar ligands, thus helping pinpoint
	the function. In the present work, we ask the following question:
	is it possible to discriminate within a dataset of non-homologous
	proteins those that bind similar ligands based on their binding site
	similarities? METHODS: We implement a graph-matching-based method
	for the detection of 3D atomic similarities introducing some simplifications
	that allow us to extend its applicability to the analysis of large
	allatom binding site models. This method, called IsoCleft, does not
	require atoms to be connected either in sequence or space. We apply
	the method to a cognate-ligand bound dataset of non-homologous proteins.
	We define a family of binding site models with decreasing knowledge
	about the identity of the ligand-interacting atoms to uncouple the
	questions of predicting the location of the binding site and detecting
	binding site similarities. Furthermore, we calculate the individual
	contributions of binding site size, chemical composition and geometry
	to prediction performance. RESULTS: We find that it is possible to
	discriminate between different ligand-binding sites. In other words,
	there is a certain uniqueness in the set of atoms that are in contact
	to specific ligand scaffolds. This uniqueness is restricted to the
	atoms in close proximity of the ligand in which case, size and chemical
	composition alone are sufficient to discriminate binding sites. Discrimination
	ability decreases with decreasing knowledge about the identity of
	the ligand-interacting binding site atoms. The decrease is quite
	abrupt when considering size and chemical composition alone, but
	much slower when including geometry. We also observe that certain
	ligands are easier to discriminate. Interestingly, the subset of
	binding site atoms belonging to highly conserved residues is not
	sufficient to discriminate binding sites, implying that convergently
	evolved binding sites arrived at dissimilar solutions. AVAILABILITY:

  abstract = {Apoptosis, a highly conserved form of cell suicide, is regulated by
	apoptotic signals and their transduction with caspases, a family
	of cystein proteases. Caspases are constantly expressed in the normal
	cells as inactive pro-enzymes. The activity of caspase is regulated
	by the proteolysis. Sequential proteolytic reactions of caspases
	are needed to execute apoptosis. Mitochondrial pathway is one of
	these apoptotic signal pathways, in which caspases are oligomerized
	into characteristic heptamer structure, called apoptosome, with caspase-9
	that activate the effector caspases for apoptosis. To investigate
	the dynamics of signal transduction pathway regulated by oligomerization,
	we construct a mathematical model for Apaf-1 heptamer assembly process.
	The model first reveals that intermediate products can remain unconverted
	even after all assemble reactions are completed. The second result
	of the model is that the conversion efficiency of Apaf-1 heptamer
	assembly is maximized when the initial concentration of cytochrome
	c is equal to that of Apaf-1. When the concentration of cytochrome
	c is sufficiently larger or smaller than that of Apaf-1, the final
	Apaf-1 heptamer production is decreased, because intermediate Apaf-1
	oligomers (tetramers and bigger oligomers), which themselves are
	unable to form active heptamer, accumulate too fast in the cells,
	choking a smooth production of Apaf-1 heptamer. Slow activation of
	Apaf-1 monomers and small oligomers increase the conversion efficiency.
	We also study the optimal number of subunits comprising an active
	oligomer that maximize the conversion efficiency in assembly process,
	and found that the tetramer is the optimum.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Prediction of which peptides will bind a specific major
	histocompatibility complex (MHC) constitutes an important step in
	identifying potential T-cell epitopes suitable as vaccine candidates.
	MHC class II binding peptides have a broad length distribution complicating
	such predictions. Thus, identifying the correct alignment is a crucial
	part of identifying the core of an MHC class II binding motif. In
	this context, we wish to describe a novel Gibbs motif sampler method
	ideally suited for recognizing such weak sequence motifs. The method
	is based on the Gibbs sampling method, and it incorporates novel
	features optimized for the task of recognizing the binding motif
	of MHC classes I and II. The method locates the binding motif in
	a set of sequences and characterizes the motif in terms of a weight-matrix.
	Subsequently, the weight-matrix can be applied to identifying effectively
	potential MHC binding peptides and to guiding the process of rational
	vaccine design. RESULTS: We apply the motif sampler method to the
	complex problem of MHC class II binding. The input to the method
	is amino acid peptide sequences extracted from the public databases
	of SYFPEITHI and MHCPEP and known to bind to the MHC class II complex
	HLA-DR4(B1*0401). Prior identification of information-rich (anchor)
	positions in the binding motif is shown to improve the predictive
	performance of the Gibbs sampler. Similarly, a consensus solution
	obtained from an ensemble average over suboptimal solutions is shown
	to outperform the use of a single optimal solution. In a large-scale
	benchmark calculation, the performance is quantified using relative
	operating characteristics curve (ROC) plots and we make a detailed
	comparison of the performance with that of both the TEPITOPE method
	and a weight-matrix derived using the conventional alignment algorithm
	of ClustalW. The calculation demonstrates that the predictive performance
	of the Gibbs sampler is higher than that of ClustalW and in most
	cases also higher than that of the TEPITOPE method.},

	derived using a single sequence-encoding scheme. The new method is
	shown to have a performance that is substantially higher than that
	of other methods. By use of mutual information calculations we show
	that peptides that bind to the HLA A*0204 complex display signal
	of higher order sequence correlations. Neural networks are ideally
	suited to integrate such higher order correlations when predicting
	the binding affinity. It is this feature combined with the use of
	several neural networks derived from different and novel sequence-encoding
	schemes and the ability of the neural network to be trained on data
	consisting of continuous binding affinities that gives the new method
	an improved performance. The difference in predictive performance
	between the neural network methods and that of the matrix-driven
	methods is found to be most significant for peptides that bind strongly
	to the HLA molecule, confirming that the signal of higher order sequence

	search for new diagnostic markers. METHODS: We analysed gene-expression
	patterns of 41 soft-tissue tumours with spotted cDNA microarrays.
	After removal of errors introduced by use of different microarray
	batches, the expression patterns of 5520 genes that were well defined
	were used to separate tumours into discrete groups by hierarchical
	clustering and singular value decomposition. FINDINGS: Synovial sarcomas,
	gastrointestinal stromal tumours, neural tumours, and a subset of
	the leiomyosarcomas, showed strikingly distinct gene-expression patterns.
	Other tumour categories--malignant fibrous histiocytoma, liposarcoma,
	and the remaining leiomyosarcomas--shared molecular profiles that
	were not predicted by histological features or immunohistochemistry.
	Strong expression of known genes, such as KIT in gastrointestinal
	stromal tumours, was noted within gene sets that distinguished the
	different sarcomas. However, many uncharacterised genes also contributed
	to the distinction between tumour types. INTERPRETATION: These results
	suggest a new method for classification of soft-tissue tumours, which
	could improve on the method based on histological findings. Large
	numbers of uncharacterised genes contributed to distinctions between
	the tumours, and some of these could be useful markers for diagnosis,
	have prognostic significance, or prove possible targets for treatment.},

	the visual pigment in rod photoreceptor cells. Substantial improvement
	of the resolution limit to 2.2 A has been achieved by new crystallization
	conditions, which also reduce significantly the probability of merohedral
	twinning in the crystals. The new structure completely resolves the
	polypeptide chain and provides further details of the chromophore
	binding site including the configuration about the C6-C7 single bond
	of the 11-cis-retinal Schiff base. Based on both an earlier structure
	and the new improved model of the protein, a theoretical study of
	the chromophore geometry has been carried out using combined quantum
	mechanics/force field molecular dynamics. The consistency between
	the experimental and calculated chromophore structures is found to
	be significantly improved for the 2.2 A model, including the angle
	of the negatively twisted 6-s-cis-bond. Importantly, the new crystal
	structure refinement reveals significant negative pre-twist of the
	C11-C12 double bond and this is also supported by the theoretical
	calculation although the latter converges to a smaller value. Bond
	alternation along the unsaturated chain is significant, but weaker
	in the calculated structure than the one obtained from the X-ray
	data. Other differences between the experimental and theoretical
	structures in the chromophore binding site are discussed with respect

	to search for Complimentary Ligands Based on Receptor Information
	(CoLiBRI). CoLiBRI is based on the representation of both receptor
	binding sites and their respective ligands in a space of universal
	chemical descriptors. The binding site atoms involved in the interaction
	with ligands are identified by the means of a computational geometry
	technique known as Delaunay tessellation as applied to X-ray characterized
	ligand-receptor complexes. TAE/RECON multiple chemical descriptors
	are calculated independently for each ligand as well as for its active
	site atoms. The representation of both ligands and active sites using
	chemical descriptors allows the application of well-known chemometric
	techniques in order to correlate chemical similarities between active
	sites and their respective ligands. We have established a protocol
	to map patterns of nearest neighbor active site vectors in a multidimensional
	TAE/RECON space onto those of their complementary ligands and vice
	versa. This protocol affords the prediction of a virtual complementary
	ligand vector in the ligand chemical space from the position of a
	known active site vector. This prediction is followed by chemical
	similarity calculations between this virtual ligand vector and those
	calculated for molecules in a chemical database to identify real
	compounds most similar to the virtual ligand. Consequently, the knowledge
	of the receptor active site structure affords straightforward and
	efficient identification of its complementary ligands in large databases
	of chemical compounds using rapid chemical similarity searches. Conversely,
	starting from the ligand chemical structure, one may identify possible
	complementary receptor cavities as well. We have applied the CoLiBRI
	approach to a data set of 800 X-ray characterized ligand-receptor
	complexes in the PDBbind database. Using a k nearest neighbor (kNN)
	pattern recognition approach and variable selection, we have shown
	that knowledge of the active site structure affords identification
	of its complimentary ligand among the top 1\% of a large chemical
	database in over 90\% of all test active sites when a binding site
	of the same protein family was present in the training set. In the
	case where test receptors are highly dissimilar and not present among
	the receptor families in the training set, the prediction accuracy
	is decreased; however, CoLiBRI was still able to quickly eliminate
	75\% of the chemical database as improbable ligands. CoLiBRI affords
	rapid prefiltering of a large chemical database to eliminate compounds
	that have little chance of binding to a receptor active site.},

	specific gene expression in living cells is variable and a number
	of sequence-governed, biochemical parameters of the siRNA duplex
	have been proposed for the design of an efficient siRNA. Some of
	these parameters have been clearly identified to influence the assembly
	of the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), or to favour the sequence
	preferences of the RISC endonuclease. For other parameters, it is
	difficult to ascertain whether the influence is a determinant of
	the siRNA per se, or a determinant of the target RNA, especially
	its local structural characteristics. In order to gain an insight
	into the effects of local target structure on the biological activity
	of siRNA, we have used large sets of siRNAs directed against local
	targets of the mRNAs of ICAM-1 and survivin. Target structures were
	classified as accessible or inaccessible using an original, iterative
	computational approach and by experimental RNase H mapping. The effectiveness
	of siRNA was characterized by measuring the IC50 values in cell culture
	and the maximal extent of target suppression. Mean IC50 values were

  abstract = {This paper presents a novel learning algorithm for efficient construction
	of the radial basis function ({RBF}) networks that can deliver the
	same level of accuracy as the support vector machines ({SVM}s) in
	data classification applications. {T}he proposed learning algorithm
	works by constructing one {RBF} subnetwork to approximate the probability
	density function of each class of objects in the training data set.
	{W}ith respect to algorithm design, the main distinction of the proposed
	learning algorithm is the novel kernel density estimation algorithm
	that features an average time complexity of {O}(n log n), where n
	is the number of samples in the training data set. {O}ne important
	advantage of the proposed learning algorithm, in comparison with
	the {SVM}, is that the proposed learning algorithm generally takes
	far less time to construct a data classifier with an optimized parameter
	setting. {T}his feature is of significance for many contemporary
	applications, in particular, for those applications in which new
	objects are continuously added into an already large database. {A}nother
	desirable feature of the proposed learning algorithm is that the
	{RBF} networks constructed are capable of carrying out data classification
	with more than two classes of objects in one single run. {I}n other
	words, unlike with the {SVM}, there is no need to resort to mechanisms
	such as one-against-one or one-against-all for handling datasets
	with more than two classes of objects. {T}he comparison with {SVM}
	is of particular interest, because it has been shown in a number
	of recent studies that {SVM} generally are able to deliver higher
	classification accuracy than the other existing data classification
	algorithms. {A}s the proposed learning algorithm is instance-based,
	the data reduction issue is also addressed in this paper. {O}ne interesting
	observation in this regard is that, for all three data sets used
	in data reduction experiments, the number of training samples remaining
	after a naive data reduction mechanism is applied is quite close
	to the number of support vectors identified by the {SVM} software.
	{T}his paper also compares the performance of the {RBF} networks
	constructed with the proposed learning algorithm and those constructed
	with a conventional cluster-based learning algorithm. {T}he most
	interesting observation learned is that, with respect to data classification,
	the distributions of training samples near the boundaries between
	different classes of objects carry more crucial information than
	the distributions of samples in the inner parts of the clusters.}

	holds great promise in the field of cancer therapy. The discovery
	of RNAi has generated enthusiasm within the scientific community,
	not only because it has been used to rapidly identify key molecules
	involved in many disease processes including cancer, but also because
	RNAi has the potential to be translated into a technology with major
	therapeutic applications. Our evolving understanding of the molecular
	pathways important for carcinogenesis has created opportunities for
	cancer therapy employing RNAi technology to target the key molecules
	within these pathways. Many gene products involved in carcinogenesis
	have already been explored as targets for RNAi intervention, and
	RNAi targeting of molecules crucial for tumor-host interactions and
	tumor resistance to chemo- or radiotherapy has also been investigated.
	In most of these studies, the silencing of critical gene products
	by RNAi technology has generated significant antiproliferative and/or
	proapoptotic effects in cell-culture systems or in preclinical animal
	models. Nevertheless, significant obstacles, such as in vivo delivery,
	incomplete suppression of target genes, nonspecific immune responses
	and the so-called off-target effects, need to be overcome before
	this technology can be successfully translated into the clinical
	arena. Significant progress has already been made in addressing some
	of these issues, and it is foreseen that early phase clinical trials

	levels for thousands of genes simultaneously. When the magnitude
	of the experiment increases, it becomes common to use the same type
	of microarrays from different laboratories or hospitals. Thus, it
	is important to analyze microarray data together to derive a combined
	conclusion after accounting for the differences. One of the main
	objectives of the microarray experiment is to identify differentially
	expressed genes among the different experimental groups. The analysis
	of variance (ANOVA) model has been commonly used to detect differentially
	expressed genes after accounting for the sources of variation commonly
	observed in the microarray experiment. RESULTS: We extended the usual
	ANOVA model to account for an additional variability resulting from
	many confounding variables such as the effect of different hospitals.
	The proposed model is a two-stage ANOVA model. The first stage is
	the adjustment for the effects of no interests. The second stage
	is the detection of differentially expressed genes among the experimental
	groups using the residuals obtained from the first stage. Based on
	these residuals, we propose a permutation test to detect the differentially
	expressed genes. The proposed model is illustrated using the data
	from 133 microarrays collected at three different hospitals. The
	proposed approach is more flexible to use, and it is easier to accommodate
	the individual covariates in this model than using the meta-analysis
	approach. AVAILABILITY: A set of programs written in R will be electronically

	for most peptides, each side-chain of the peptide contributes a certain
	amount to the stability of the HLA-A2 complex that is independent
	of the sequence of the peptide. To quantify these contributions,
	the binding data from a set of 154 peptides were combined together
	to generate a table containing 180 coefficients (20 amino acids x
	9 positions), each of which represents the contribution of one particular
	amino acid residue at a specified position within the peptide to
	binding to HLA-A2. Eighty peptides formed stable HLA-A2 complexes,
	as assessed by measuring the rate of dissociation of beta 2m. The
	remaining 74 peptides formed complexes that had a half-life of beta
	2m dissociation of less than 5 min at 37 degrees C, or did not bind
	to HLA-A2, and were included because they could be used to constrain
	the values of some of the coefficients. The "theoretical" binding
	stability (calculated by multiplying together the corresponding coefficients)
	matched the experimental binding stability to within a factor of
	5. The coefficients were then used to calculate the theoretical binding
	stability for all the previously identified self or antigenic nonamer
	peptides known to bind to HLA-A2. The binding stability for all other
	nonamer peptides that could be generated from the proteins from which
	these peptides were derived was also predicted. In every case, the
	previously described HLA-A2 binding peptides were ranked in the top
	2\% of all possible nonamers for each source protein. Therefore,
	most biologically relevant nonamer peptides should be identifiable
	using the table of coefficients. We conclude that the side-chains

	strategies to map molecular functional features of gene products

	455 genetically inherited diseases that have been mapped to chromosomal
	regions without assignment of a particular gene. In a benchmark of

	of the conformational changes drug-like molecules experience upon
	binding. Ligand strain energies and conformational reorganization
	were analyzed with different computational methods on 150 crystal
	structures of pharmaceutically relevant protein-ligand complexes.
	The common knowledge that ligands rarely bind in their lowest calculated
	energy conformation was confirmed. Additionally, we found that over
	60\% of the ligands do not bind in a local minimum conformation.
	While approximately 60\% of the ligands were calculated to bind with
	strain energies lower than 5 kcal/mol, strain energies over 9 kcal/mol
	were calculated in at least 10\% of the cases regardless of the method
	used. A clear correlation was found between acceptable strain energy
	and ligand flexibility, while there was no correlation between strain
	energy and binding affinity, thus indicating that expensive conformational
	rearrangements can be tolerated in some cases without overly penalizing
	the tightness of binding. On the basis of the trends observed, thresholds
	for the acceptable strain energies of bioactive conformations were
	defined with consideration of the impact of ligand flexibility. An
	analysis of the degree of folding of the bound ligands confirmed
	the general tendency of small molecules to bind in an extended conformation.
	The results suggest that the unfolding of hydrophobic ligands during
	binding, which exposes hydrophobic surfaces to contact with protein
	residues, could be one of the factors accounting for high reorganization
	energies. Finally, different methods for conformational analysis
	were evaluated, and guidelines were defined to maximize the prevalence
	of bioactive conformations in computationally generated ensembles.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Many processes in molecular biology involve the recognition
	of short sequences of nucleic-or amino acids, such as the binding
	of immunogenic peptides to major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
	molecules. From experimental data, a model of the sequence specificity
	of these processes can be constructed, such as a sequence motif,
	a scoring matrix or an artificial neural network. The purpose of
	these models is two-fold. First, they can provide a summary of experimental
	results, allowing for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms involved
	in sequence recognition. Second, such models can be used to predict
	the experimental outcome for yet untested sequences. In the past
	we reported the development of a method to generate such models called
	the Stabilized Matrix Method (SMM). This method has been successfully
	applied to predicting peptide binding to MHC molecules, peptide transport
	by the transporter associated with antigen presentation (TAP) and
	proteasomal cleavage of protein sequences. RESULTS: Herein we report
	the implementation of the SMM algorithm as a publicly available software
	package. Specific features determining the type of problems the method
	is most appropriate for are discussed. Advantageous features of the
	package are: (1) the output generated is easy to interpret, (2) input
	and output are both quantitative, (3) specific computational strategies
	to handle experimental noise are built in, (4) the algorithm is designed
	to effectively handle bounded experimental data, (5) experimental
	data from randomized peptide libraries and conventional peptides
	can easily be combined, and (6) it is possible to incorporate pair
	interactions between positions of a sequence. CONCLUSION: Making
	the SMM method publicly available enables bioinformaticians and experimental
	biologists to easily access it, to compare its performance to other

	(FasL)-mediated apoptosis, and a complex and internally strongly
	linked network is assembled around the central FasL-mediated apoptosis
	cascade. Different bioinformatical techniques are employed and different
	crosstalk possibilities including the integrin pathway are considered.
	This network is translated into a Boolean network (74 nodes, 108

	using the software SQUAD. Testing a number of alternative crosstalk
	possibilities and networks we find that there are four stable system

	apoptosis by the intrinsic and the extrinsic pathways, respectively.
	The model is validated by comparing it to experimental data from
	kinetics of cytochrome c release and caspase activation in wildtype
	and Bid knockout cells grown on different substrates. Pathophysiological
	modifications such as input from cytomegalovirus proteins M36 and

  abstract = {Gene dosage variations occur in many diseases. In cancer, deletions
	and copy number increases contribute to alterations in the expression
	of tumour-suppressor genes and oncogenes, respectively. Developmental
	abnormalities, such as Down, Prader Willi, Angelman and Cri du Chat
	syndromes, result from gain or loss of one copy of a chromosome or
	chromosomal region. Thus, detection and mapping of copy number abnormalities
	provide an approach for associating aberrations with disease phenotype
	and for localizing critical genes. Comparative genomic hybridization
	(CGH) was developed for genome-wide analysis of DNA sequence copy
	number in a single experiment. In CGH, differentially labelled total
	genomic DNA from a 'test' and a 'reference' cell population are cohybridized
	to normal metaphase chromosomes, using blocking DNA to suppress signals
	from repetitive sequences. The resulting ratio of the fluorescence
	intensities at a location on the 'cytogenetic map', provided by the
	chromosomes, is approximately proportional to the ratio of the copy
	numbers of the corresponding DNA sequences in the test and reference
	genomes. CGH has been broadly applied to human and mouse malignancies.
	The use of metaphase chromosomes, however, limits detection of events
	involving small regions (of less than 20 Mb) of the genome, resolution
	of closely spaced aberrations and linking ratio changes to genomic/genetic
	markers. Therefore, more laborious locus-by-locus techniques have
	been required for higher resolution studies. Hybridization to an
	array of mapped sequences instead of metaphase chromosomes could
	overcome the limitations of conventional CGH (ref. 6) if adequate
	performance could be achieved. Copy number would be related to the
	test/reference fluorescence ratio on the array targets, and genomic
	resolution could be determined by the map distance between the targets,
	or by the length of the cloned DNA segments. We describe here our
	implementation of array CGH. We demonstrate its ability to measure
	copy number with high precision in the human genome, and to analyse
	clinical specimens by obtaining new information on chromosome 20

	{T}he aim of this paper is to systematically benchmark the role of
	non-linear versus linear techniques and dimensionality reduction
	methods. {R}esults: {A} systematic benchmarking study is performed
	by comparing linear versions of standard classification and dimensionality
	reduction techniques with their non-linear versions based on non-linear
	kernel functions with a radial basis function ({RBF}) kernel. {A}
	total of 9 binary cancer classification problems, derived from 7
	publicly available microarray datasets, and 20 randomizations of

	can be formulated based on the performances on independent test sets.
	(1) {W}hen performing classification with least squares support vector
	machines ({LS}-{SVM}s) (without dimensionality reduction), {RBF}
	kernels can be used without risking too much overfitting. {T}he results
	obtained with well-tuned {RBF} kernels are never worse and sometimes
	even statistically significantly better compared to results obtained
	with a linear kernel in terms of test set receiver operating characteristic
	and test set accuracy performances. (2) {E}ven for classification
	with linear classifiers like {LS}-{SVM} with linear kernel, using
	regularization is very important. (3) {W}hen performing kernel principal
	component analysis (kernel {PCA}) before classification, using an
	{RBF} kernel for kernel {PCA} tends to result in overfitting, especially
	when using supervised feature selection. {I}t has been observed that
	an optimal selection of a large number of features is often an indication
	for overfitting. {K}ernel {PCA} with linear kernel gives better results.

	that the classifier uses to compare pairs of structures. RESULTS:
	We describe a kernel that is derived in a straightforward fashion
	from an existing structural alignment program, MAMMOTH. We find in
	our benchmark experiments that this kernel significantly out-performs
	a variety of other kernels, including several previously described
	kernels. Furthermore, in both benchmarks, classifying structures
	using MAMMOTH alone does not work as well as using an SVM with the
	MAMMOTH kernel. AVAILABILITY: http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/3dkernel},

  volume = {33},
  pages = {1834--1847},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {RNA interference (RNAi) is an intracellular mechanism for post-transcriptional
	gene silencing that is frequently used to study gene function. RNAi
	is initiated by short interfering RNA (siRNA) of approximately 21
	nt in length, either generated from the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)
	by using the enzyme Dicer or introduced experimentally. Following
	association with an RNAi silencing complex, siRNA targets mRNA transcripts
	that have sequence identity for destruction. A phenotype resulting
	from this knockdown of expression may inform about the function of
	the targeted gene. However, 'off-target effects' compromise the specificity
	of RNAi if sequence identity between siRNA and random mRNA transcripts
	causes RNAi to knockdown expression of non-targeted genes. The complete
	off-target effects must be investigated systematically on each gene
	in a genome by adjusting a group of parameters, which is too expensive
	to conduct experimentally and motivates a study in silico. This computational
	study examined the potential for off-target effects of RNAi, employing
	the genome and transcriptome sequence data of Homo sapiens, Caenorhabditis
	elegans and Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The chance for RNAi off-target
	effects proved considerable, ranging from 5 to 80\% for each of the
	organisms, when using as parameter the exact identity between any
	possible siRNA sequences (arbitrary length ranging from 17 to 28
	nt) derived from a dsRNA (range 100-400 nt) representing the coding
	sequences of target genes and all other siRNAs within the genome.
	Remarkably, high-sequence specificity and low probability for off-target
	reactivity were optimally balanced for siRNA of 21 nt, the length
	observed mostly in vivo. The chance for off-target RNAi increased
	(although not always significantly) with greater length of the initial
	dsRNA sequence, inclusion into the analysis of available untranslated
	region sequences and allowing for mismatches between siRNA and target
	sequences. siRNA sequences from within 100 nt of the 5' termini of
	coding sequences had low chances for off-target reactivity. This
	may be owing to coding constraints for signal peptide-encoding regions
	of genes relative to regions that encode for mature proteins. Off-target
	distribution varied along the chromosomes of C.elegans, apparently
	owing to the use of more unique sequences in gene-dense regions.
	Finally, biological and thermodynamical descriptors of effective
	siRNA reduced the number of potential siRNAs compared with those
	identified by sequence identity alone, but off-target RNAi remained
	likely, with an off-target error rate of approximately 10\%. These
	results also suggest a direction for future in vivo studies that
	could both help in calibrating true off-target rates in living organisms
	and also in contributing evidence toward the debate of whether siRNA
	efficacy is correlated with, or independent of, the target molecule.
	In summary, off-target effects present a real but not prohibitive
	concern that should be considered for RNAi experiments.},

  abstract = {B{ACKGROUND}: {A} large number of papers have been published on analysis
	of microarray data with particular emphasis on normalization of data,
	detection of differentially expressed genes, clustering of genes
	and regulatory network. {O}n other hand there are only few studies
	on relation between expression level and composition of nucleotide/protein
	sequence, using expression data. {T}here is a need to understand
	why particular genes/proteins express more in particular conditions.
	{I}n this study, we analyze 3468 genes of {S}accharomyces cerevisiae
	obtained from {H}olstege et al., (1998) to understand the relationship
	between expression level and amino acid composition. {RESULTS}: {W}e
	compute the correlation between expression of a gene and amino acid
	composition of its protein. {I}t was observed that some residues
	(like {A}la, {G}ly, {A}rg and {V}al) have significant positive correlation
	(r > 0.20) and some other residues ({L}ike {A}sp, {L}eu, {A}sn and
	{S}er) have negative correlation (r < -0.15) with the expression
	of genes. {A} significant negative correlation (r = -0.18) was also
	found between length and gene expression. {T}hese observations indicate
	the relationship between percent composition and gene expression
	level. {T}hus, attempts have been made to develop a {S}upport {V}ector
	{M}achine ({SVM}) based method for predicting the expression level
	of genes from its protein sequence. {I}n this method the {SVM} is
	trained with proteins whose gene expression data is known in a given
	condition. {T}hen trained {SVM} is used to predict the gene expression
	of other proteins of the same organism in the same condition. {A}
	correlation coefficient r = 0.70 was obtained between predicted and
	experimentally determined expression of genes, which improves from
	r = 0.70 to 0.72 when dipeptide composition was used instead of residue
	composition. {T}he method was evaluated using 5-fold cross validation
	test. {W}e also demonstrate that amino acid composition information
	along with gene expression data can be used for improving the function
	classification of proteins. {CONCLUSION}: {T}here is a correlation
	between gene expression and amino acid composition that can be used
	to predict the expression level of genes up to a certain extent.

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Protein remote homology detection is a central problem
	in computational biology. Supervised learning algorithms based on
	support vector machines are currently one of the most effective methods
	for remote homology detection. The performance of these methods depends
	on how the protein sequences are modeled and on the method used to
	compute the kernel function between them. RESULTS: We introduce two
	classes of kernel functions that are constructed by combining sequence
	profiles with new and existing approaches for determining the similarity
	between pairs of protein sequences. These kernels are constructed
	directly from these explicit protein similarity measures and employ
	effective profile-to-profile scoring schemes for measuring the similarity
	between pairs of proteins. Experiments with remote homology detection
	and fold recognition problems show that these kernels are capable
	of producing results that are substantially better than those produced
	by all of the existing state-of-the-art SVM-based methods. In addition,
	the experiments show that these kernels, even when used in the absence
	of profiles, produce results that are better than those produced
	by existing non-profile-based schemes. AVAILABILITY: The programs
	for computing the various kernel functions are available on request

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Array-based comparative genomic hybridization (arrayCGH)
	has recently become a popular tool to identify DNA copy number variations
	along the genome. These profiles are starting to be used as markers
	to improve prognosis or diagnosis of cancer, which implies that methods
	for automated supervised classification of arrayCGH data are needed.
	Like gene expression profiles, arrayCGH profiles are characterized
	by a large number of variables usually measured on a limited number
	of samples. However, arrayCGH profiles have a particular structure
	of correlations between variables, due to the spatial organization
	of bacterial artificial chromosomes along the genome. This suggests
	that classical classification methods, often based on the selection
	of a small number of discriminative features, may not be the most
	accurate methods and may not produce easily interpretable prediction
	rules. RESULTS: We propose a new method for supervised classification
	of arrayCGH data. The method is a variant of support vector machine
	that incorporates the biological specificities of DNA copy number
	variations along the genome as prior knowledge. The resulting classifier
	is a sparse linear classifier based on a limited number of regions
	automatically selected on the chromosomes, leading to easy interpretation
	and identification of discriminative regions of the genome. We test
	this method on three classification problems for bladder and uveal
	cancer, involving both diagnosis and prognosis. We demonstrate that
	the introduction of the new prior on the classifier leads not only
	to more accurate predictions, but also to the identification of known
	and new regions of interest in the genome. AVAILABILITY: All data

  abstract = {Peptides that bind to a given major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
	molecule share sequence similarity. Therefore, a position specific
	scoring matrix (PSSM) or profile derived from a set of peptides known
	to bind to a specific MHC molecule would be a suitable predictor
	of whether other peptides might bind, thus anticipating possible
	T-cell epitopes within a protein. In this approach, the binding potential
	of any peptide sequence (query) to a given MHC molecule is linked
	to its similarity to a group of aligned peptides known to bind to
	that MHC, and can be obtained by comparing the query to the PSSM.
	This article describes the derivation of alignments and profiles
	from a collection of peptides known to bind a specific MHC, compatible
	with the structural and molecular basis of the peptide-MHC class
	I (MHCI) interaction. Moreover, in order to apply these profiles
	to the prediction of peptide-MHCI binding, we have developed a new
	search algorithm (RANKPEP) that ranks all possible peptides from
	an input protein using the PSSM coefficients. The predictive power
	of the method was evaluated by running RANKPEP on proteins known
	to bear MHCI K(b)- and D(b)-restricted T-cell epitopes. Analysis
	of the results indicates that > 80\% of these epitopes are among
	the top 2\% of scoring peptides. Prediction of peptide-MHC binding
	using a variety of MHCI-specific PSSMs is available on line at our
	RANKPEP web server (www.mifoundation.org/Tools/rankpep.html). In
	addition, the RANKPEP server also allows the user to enter additional

	identification. Here, using PSSMs that are structurally consistent
	with the binding mode of MHC class II (MHCII) ligands, we have extended
	RANKPEP to prediction of peptide-MHCII binding and anticipation of
	CD4 T-cell epitopes. Currently, 88 and 50 different MHCI and MHCII
	molecules, respectively, can be targeted for peptide binding predictions
	in RANKPEP. Because appropriate processing of antigenic peptides
	must occur prior to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding,
	cleavage site prediction methods are important adjuncts for T-cell
	epitope discovery. Given that the C-terminus of most MHCI-restricted
	epitopes results from proteasomal cleavage, we have modeled the cleavage
	site from known MHCI-restricted epitopes using statistical language
	models. The RANKPEP server now determines whether the C-terminus
	of any predicted MHCI ligand may result from such proteasomal cleavage.
	Also implemented is a variability masking function. This feature
	focuses prediction on conserved rather than highly variable protein
	segments encoded by infectious genomes, thereby offering identification

  abstract = {Orthologs are genes in different species that originate from a single
	gene in the last common ancestor of these species. Such genes have
	often retained identical biological roles in the present-day organisms.
	It is hence important to identify orthologs for transferring functional
	information between genes in different organisms with a high degree
	of reliability. For example, orthologs of human proteins are often
	functionally characterized in model organisms. Unfortunately, orthology
	analysis between human and e.g. invertebrates is often complex because
	of large numbers of paralogs within protein families. Paralogs that
	predate the species split, which we call out-paralogs, can easily
	be confused with true orthologs. Paralogs that arose after the species
	split, which we call in-paralogs, however, are bona fide orthologs
	by definition.Orthologs and in-paralogs are typically detected with
	phylogenetic methods, but these are slow and difficult to automate.
	Automatic clustering methods based on two-way best genome-wide matches
	on the other hand, have so far not separated in-paralogs from out-paralogs
	effectively.We present a fully automatic method for finding orthologs
	and in-paralogs from two species. Ortholog clusters are seeded with
	a two-way best pairwise match, after which an algorithm for adding
	in-paralogs is applied. The method bypasses multiple alignments and
	phylogenetic trees, which can be slow and error-prone steps in classical
	ortholog detection. Still, it robustly detects complex orthologous
	relationships and assigns confidence values for both orthologs and
	in-paralogs. The program, called INPARANOID, was tested on all completely
	sequenced eukaryotic genomes. To assess the quality of INPARANOID
	results, ortholog clusters were generated from a dataset of worm
	and mammalian transmembrane proteins, and were compared to clusters
	derived by manual tree-based ortholog detection methods. This study
	led to the identification with a high degree of confidence of over
	a dozen novel worm-mammalian ortholog assignments that were previously
	undetected because of shortcomings of phylogenetic methods.A WWW
	server that allows searching for orthologs between human and several
	fully sequenced genomes is installed at http://www.cgb.ki.se/inparanoid/.
	This is the first comprehensive resource with orthologs of all fully
	sequenced eukaryotic genomes. Programs and tables of orthology assignments

	model system due to its high rate of homologous recombination, haploidy,
	simple body plan, physiological properties as well as phylogenetic
	position. {A}vailable {EST} data was clustered and assembled, and
	provided the basis for a genome-wide analysis of protein encoding
	genes. {RESULTS}: {W}e have clustered and assembled {P}hyscomitrella
	patens {EST} and {CDS} data in order to represent the transcriptome
	of this non-seed plant. {C}lustering of the publicly available data
	and subsequent prediction resulted in a total of 19,081 non-redundant
	{ORF}. {O}f these putative transcripts, approximately 30\% have a
	homolog in both rice and {A}rabidopsis transcriptome. {M}ore than
	130 transcripts are not present in seed plants but can be found in
	other kingdoms. {T}hese potential "retained genes" might have been
	lost during seed plant evolution. {F}unctional annotation of these
	genes reveals unequal distribution among taxonomic groups and intriguing
	putative functions such as cytotoxicity and nucleic acid repair.
	{W}hereas introns in the moss are larger on average than in the seed
	plant {A}rabidopsis thaliana, position and amount of introns are
	approximately the same. {C}ontrary to {A}rabidopsis, where {CDS}
	contain on average 44\% {G}/{C}, in {P}hyscomitrella the average
	{G}/{C} content is 50\%. {I}nterestingly, moss orthologs of {A}rabidopsis
	genes show a significant drift of codon fraction usage, towards the
	seed plant. {W}hile averaged codon bias is the same in {P}hyscomitrella
	and {A}rabidopsis, the distribution pattern is different, with 15\%
	of moss genes being unbiased. {S}pecies-specific, sensitive and selective
	splice site prediction for {P}hyscomitrella has been developed using
	a dataset of 368 donor and acceptor sites, utilizing a support vector
	machine. {T}he prediction accuracy is better than those achieved
	with tools trained on {A}rabidopsis data. {CONCLUSION}: {A}nalysis
	of the moss transcriptome displays differences in gene structure,
	codon and splice site usage in comparison with the seed plant {A}rabidopsis.
	{P}utative retained genes exhibit possible functions that might explain
	the peculiar physiological properties of mosses. {B}oth the transcriptome

	we have relatively good assignment of {GO} terms to proteins, but

	have examined the genome-wide binding and cleavage properties of

	prevents DSB cleavage by tethered Gal4BD-Spo11 since its displacement
	restores targeted DSB formation. In addition, we observed that new
	DSBs introduced by Gal4BD-Spo11 inhibit surrounding DSB formation
	over long distances (up to 60 kb), keeping constant the number of
	DSBs per chromosomal region. Together, these results demonstrate
	that the targeting of Spo11 to new chromosomal locations leads to
	both local stimulation and genome-wide redistribution of recombination
	initiation and that some chromosomal regions are inherently cold

  abstract = {We present a new method for docking flexible peptides to class I Major-Histocompatibility-Complex
	(MHC) receptors. Docking is performed in two steps: (a) The charged
	terminal peptide residues are located by randomly distributing multiple
	copies of each in volumes of approximately 150 A at either end of
	the binding groove, and then minimizing the system energy using a
	modified multiple-copy search algorithm. This is followed by (b)
	construction of the intervening chain using the multiple-copy bond-scaling-relaxation
	loop closure algorithm. In both steps, the copies tend to cluster
	and the size of the resulting clusters is proportional to the basin
	of attraction of the corresponding energy well. We show that native
	MHC-bound peptides have broad minima and, consequently, that misfolded,
	low-energy peptide conformations can be eliminated by restricting
	consideration to groups of peptides which cluster into broad minima.
	The accuracy of the method is assessed by comparing the predictions
	with crystallographic data for three different MHC peptide systems,
	at various degrees of stringency: (a) the extent to which we can
	determine side chain function (anchor vs. T-cell epitopes); (b) the
	extent to which we can determine the peptide-receptor orientation;
	and (c) the accuracy with which we can predict atomic coordinates.
	We find the method correct on (a) for 19 of the 22 non-Gly positions;
	the failures appearing to be a consequence of omitting solvation.
	Predictions related to (b) are also very encouraging, with the overall
	orientation of the predicted peptides being very similar to the crystal
	conformation, when measured by the hydrogen bonding pattern between
	the two. The degree of success in predicting atomic coordinates varied
	considerably, however, from 1.4 A for the HLA-A2 peptide to 2.7 A
	for the Kb peptide. The inaccuracy of the latter appears to reflect
	an incomplete target function, most likely the ommission of solvation.
	The calculations thus define the current limits of accuracy in docking
	flexible peptides to Class I receptors and identify the methodological
	improvements that must be made for the next advance in accuracy.},

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {E}ukaryotic pre-m{RNA}s are spliced to form mature
	m{RNA}. {P}re-m{RNA} alternative splicing greatly increases the complexity
	of gene expression. {E}stimates show that more than half of the human
	genes and at least one-third of the genes of less complex organisms,
	such as nematodes or flies, are alternatively spliced. {I}n this
	work, we consider one major form of alternative splicing, namely
	the exclusion of exons from the transcript. {I}t has been shown that
	alternatively spliced exons have certain properties that distinguish
	them from constitutively spliced exons. {A}lthough most recent computational
	studies on alternative splicing apply only to exons which are conserved
	among two species, our method only uses information that is available
	to the splicing machinery, i.e. the {DNA} sequence itself. {W}e employ
	advanced machine learning techniques in order to answer the following
	two questions: (1) {I}s a certain exon alternatively spliced? (2)
	{H}ow can we identify yet unidentified exons within known introns?
	{RESULTS}: {W}e designed a support vector machine ({SVM}) kernel
	well suited for the task of classifying sequences with motifs having
	positional preferences. {I}n order to solve the task (1), we combine
	the kernel with additional local sequence information, such as lengths
	of the exon and the flanking introns. {T}he resulting {SVM}-based
	classifier achieves a true positive rate of 48.5\% at a false positive
	rate of 1\%. {B}y scanning over single {EST} confirmed exons we identified
	215 potential alternatively spliced exons. {F}or 10 randomly selected
	such exons we successfully performed biological verification experiments
	and confirmed three novel alternatively spliced exons. {T}o answer
	question (2), we additionally used {SVM}-based predictions to recognize
	acceptor and donor splice sites. {C}ombined with the above mentioned
	features we were able to identify 85.2\% of skipped exons within
	known introns at a false positive rate of 1\%. {AVAILABILITY}: {D}atasets,

	selection are of key importance in extracting knowledge from complex

	for feature subset selection applied to splice site prediction, based
	on estimation of distribution algorithms, a more general framework
	of genetic algorithms. {F}rom the estimated distribution of the algorithm,
	a feature ranking is derived. {A}fterwards this ranking is used to
	iteratively discard features. {W}e apply this technique to the problem
	of splice site prediction, and show how it can be used to gain insight
	into the underlying biological process of splicing. {C}onclusion
	{W}e show that this technique proves to be more robust than the traditional
	use of estimation of distribution algorithms for feature selection:
	instead of returning a single best subset of features (as they normally
	do) this method provides a dynamical view of the feature selection
	process, like the traditional sequential wrapper methods. {H}owever,
	the method is faster than the traditional techniques, and scales
	better to datasets described by a large number of features.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {501},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Modelling the interaction between potentially antigenic
	peptides and Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) molecules is
	a key step in identifying potential T-cell epitopes. For Class II
	MHC alleles, the binding groove is open at both ends, causing ambiguity
	in the positional alignment between the groove and peptide, as well
	as creating uncertainty as to what parts of the peptide interact
	with the MHC. Moreover, the antigenic peptides have variable lengths,
	making naive modelling methods difficult to apply. This paper introduces
	a kernel method that can handle variable length peptides effectively
	by quantifying similarities between peptide sequences and integrating
	these into the kernel. RESULTS: The kernel approach presented here
	shows increased prediction accuracy with a significantly higher number
	of true positives and negatives on multiple MHC class II alleles,
	when testing data sets from MHCPEP 1, MCHBN 2, and MHCBench 3. Evaluation
	by cross validation, when segregating binders and non-binders, produced
	an average of 0.824 AROC for the MHCBench data sets (up from 0.756),
	and an average of 0.96 AROC for multiple alleles of the MHCPEP database.
	CONCLUSION: The method improves performance over existing state-of-the-art
	methods of MHC class II peptide binding predictions by using a custom,
	knowledge-based representation of peptides. Similarity scores, in
	contrast to a fixed-length, pocket-specific representation of amino
	acids, provide a flexible and powerful way of modelling MHC binding,
	and can easily be applied to other dynamic sequence problems.},

	the methods employed to exploit that information are less than optimal
	and could use the information more effectively. {RESULTS}: {I}n this
	paper, we propose a new algorithm called p{SLIP} which uses {S}upport
	{V}ector {M}achines ({SVM}s) in conjunction with multiple physicochemical
	properties of amino acids to predict protein subcellular localization
	in eukaryotes across six different locations, namely, chloroplast,
	cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial, nuclear and plasma membrane.
	{T}he algorithm was applied to the dataset provided by {P}ark and
	{K}anehisa and we obtained prediction accuracies for the different
	classes ranging from 87.7\%-97.0\% with an overall accuracy of 93.1\%.
	{CONCLUSIONS}: {T}his study presents a physicochemical property based
	protein localization prediction algorithm. {U}nlike other algorithms,
	contextual information is preserved by dividing the protein sequences
	into clusters. {T}he prediction accuracy shows an improvement over
	other algorithms based on various types of amino acid composition
	(single, pair and gapped pair). {W}e have also implemented a web
	server to predict protein localization across the six classes (available
	at http://pslip.bii.a-star.edu.sg).},

	techniques, like independent component analysis (ICA) or non-negative

	These exploratory feature extraction techniques yield expression
	modes (ICA) or metagenes (NMF). These extracted features are considered
	indicative of underlying regulatory processes. They can as well be
	applied to the classification of gene expression datasets by grouping
	samples into different categories for diagnostic purposes or group
	genes into functional categories for further investigation of related
	metabolic pathways and regulatory networks. RESULTS: In this study
	we focus on unsupervised matrix factorization techniques and apply
	ICA and sparse NMF to microarray datasets. The latter monitor the
	gene expression levels of human peripheral blood cells during differentiation
	from monocytes to macrophages. We show that these tools are able
	to identify relevant signatures in the deduced component matrices
	and extract informative sets of marker genes from these gene expression
	profiles. The methods rely on the joint discriminative power of a
	set of marker genes rather than on single marker genes. With these
	sets of marker genes, corroborated by leave-one-out or random forest
	cross-validation, the datasets could easily be classified into related
	diagnostic categories. The latter correspond to either monocytes
	versus macrophages or healthy vs Niemann Pick C disease patients.},

	topological and physicochemical properties are projected from cavity-lining
	protein residues to an 80 triangle-discretised sphere placed at the
	centre of the binding site, thus defining a cavity fingerprint. Representing
	binding site properties onto a discretised sphere presents many advantages:
	(i) a normalised distance between binding sites of different sizes
	may be easily derived by summing up the normalised differences between
	the 8 computed descriptors; (ii) a structural alignment of two proteins
	is simply done by systematically rotating/translating one mobile
	sphere around one immobile reference; (iii) a certain degree of fuzziness
	in the comparison is reached by projecting global amino acid properties
	(e.g., charge, size, functional groups count, distance to the site
	centre) independently of local rotameric/tautomeric states of cavity-lining
	residues. The method was implemented in a new program (SiteAlign)
	and tested in a number of various scenarios: measuring the distance
	between 376 related active site pairs, computing the cross-similarity
	of members of a protein family, predicting the targets of ligands
	with various promiscuity levels. The proposed method is robust enough
	to detect local similarity among active sites of different sizes,
	to discriminate between protein subfamilies and to recover the known
	targets of promiscuous ligands by virtual screening.},

  abstract = {A new method has been developed to detect functional relationships
	among proteins independent of a given sequence or fold homology.
	It is based on the idea that protein function is intimately related
	to the recognition and subsequent response to the binding of a substrate
	or an endogenous ligand in a well-characterized binding pocket. Thus,
	recognition of similar ligands, supposedly linked to similar function,
	requires conserved recognition features exposed in terms of common
	physicochemical interaction properties via the functional groups
	of the residues flanking a particular binding cavity. Following a
	technique commonly used in the comparison of small molecule ligands,
	generic pseudocenters coding for possible interaction properties
	were assigned for a large sample set of cavities extracted from the
	entire PDB and stored in the database Cavbase. Using a particular
	query cavity a series of related cavities of decreasing similarity
	is detected based on a clique detection algorithm. The detected similarity
	is ranked according to property-based surface patches shared in common
	by the different clique solutions. The approach either retrieves
	protein cavities accommodating the same (e.g. co-factors) or closely
	related ligands or it extracts proteins exhibiting similar function
	in terms of a related catalytic mechanism. Finally the new method
	has strong potential to suggest alternative molecular skeletons in
	de novo design. The retrieval of molecular building blocks accommodated
	in a particular sub-pocket that shares similarity with the pocket
	in a protein studied by drug design can inspire the discovery of
	novel ligands.},

	systematically the contributions of these parameters to siRNA activity
	by using deliberately designed mRNA constructs. The siRNA target
	sites were included in well-defined structural elements rendering

	Furthermore, complementary sequence elements and various hairpins

	Only one of the strands of the siRNA duplex was found to be capable
	of silencing via its respective target site, indicating that thermodynamic
	characteristics intrinsic to the siRNA strands are a basic determinant
	of siRNA activity. A significant obstruction of gene silencing by
	the same siRNA, however, was observed to be caused by structural
	features of the substrate RNA. Bioinformatic analysis of the mRNA
	structures suggests a direct correlation between the extent of gene-knockdown
	and the local free energy in the target region. Our findings indicate
	that, although a favourable siRNA sequence is a necessary prerequisite

  abstract = {Specific binding of antigenic peptides to major histocompatibility
	complex (MHC) class I molecules is a prerequisite for their recognition
	by cytotoxic T-cells. Prediction of MHC-binding peptides must therefore
	be incorporated in any predictive algorithm attempting to identify
	immunodominant T-cell epitopes, based on the amino acid sequence
	of the protein antigen. Development of predictive algorithms based
	on experimental binding data requires experimental testing of a very
	large number of peptides. A complementary approach relies on the
	structural conservation observed in crystallographically solved peptide-MHC
	complexes. By this approach, the peptide structure in the MHC groove
	is used as a template upon which peptide candidates are threaded,
	and their compatibility to bind is evaluated by statistical pairwise
	potentials. Our original algorithm based on this approach used the
	pairwise potential table of Miyazawa and Jernigan (Miyazawa S, Jernigan
	RL, 1996, J Mol Biol 256:623-644) and succeeded to correctly identify
	good binders only for MHC molecules with hydrophobic binding pockets,
	probably because of the high emphasis of hydrophobic interactions
	in this table. A recently developed pairwise potential table by Betancourt
	and Thirumalai (Betancourt MR, Thirumalai D, 1999, Protein Sci 8:361-369)
	that is based on the Miyazawa and Jernigan table describes the hydrophilic
	interactions more appropriately. In this paper, we demonstrate how
	the use of this table, together with a new definition of MHC contact
	residues by which only residues that contribute exclusively to sequence
	specific binding are included, allows the development of an improved
	algorithm that can be applied to a wide range of MHC class I alleles.},

  abstract = {In this study we evaluate how far the scope of similarity searching
	can be extended to identify not only ligands binding to the same
	target as the reference ligand(s) but also ligands of other homologous
	targets without initially known ligands. This "homology-based similarity
	searching" requires molecular representations reflecting the ability
	of a molecule to interact with target proteins. The Similog keys,
	which are introduced here as a new molecular representation, were
	designed to fulfill such requirements. They are based only on the
	molecular constitution and are counts of atom triplets. Each triplet
	is characterized by the graph distances and the types of its atoms.
	The atom-typing scheme classifies each atom by its function as H-bond
	donor or acceptor and by its electronegativity and bulkiness. In
	this study the Similog keys are investigated in retrospective in
	silico screening experiments and compared with other conformation
	independent molecular representations. Studied were molecules of
	the MDDR database for which the activity data was augmented by standardized
	target classification information from public protein classification
	databases. The MDDR molecule set was split randomly into two halves.
	The first half formed the candidate set. Ligands of four targets
	(dopamine D2 receptor, opioid delta-receptor, factor Xa serine protease,
	and progesterone receptor) were taken from the second half to form
	the respective reference sets. Different similarity calculation methods
	are used to rank the molecules of the candidate set by their similarity
	to each of the four reference sets. The accumulated counts of molecules
	binding to the reference target and groups of targets with decreasing
	homology to it were examined as a function of the similarity rank
	for each reference set and similarity method. In summary, similarity
	searching based on Unity 2D-fingerprints or Similog keys are found
	to be equally effective in the identification of molecules binding
	to the same target as the reference set. However, the application
	of the Similog keys is more effective in comparison with the other
	investigated methods in the identification of ligands binding to
	any target belonging to the same family as the reference target.
	We attribute this superiority to the fact that the Similog keys provide
	a generalization of the chemical elements and that the keys are counted
	instead of merely noting their presence or absence in a binary form.
	The second most effective molecular representation are the occurrence
	counts of the public ISIS key fragments, which like the Similog method,
	incorporates key counting as well as a generalization of the chemical
	elements. The results obtained suggest that ligands for a new target
	can be identified by the following three-step procedure: 1. Select
	at least one target with known ligands which is homologous to the
	new target. 2. Combine the known ligands of the selected target(s)
	to a reference set. 3. Search candidate ligands for the new targets
	by their similarity to the reference set using the Similog method.
	This clearly enlarges the scope of similarity searching from the
	classical application for a single target to the identification of
	candidate ligands for whole target families and is expected to be
	of key utility for further systematic chemogenomics exploration of
	previously well explored target families.},

	on the annotation of genomic sequences. Only very limited effort
	has been put into annotation schemes for pharmaceutical ligands.
	Here we propose annotation schemes for the ligands of four major
	target classes, enzymes, G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), nuclear
	receptors (NRs), and ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs), and outline
	their usage for in silico screening and combinatorial library design.
	The proposed schemes cover ligand functionality and hierarchical
	levels of target classification. The classification schemes are based
	on those established by the EC, GPCRDB, NuclearDB, and LGICDB. The
	ligands of the MDL Drug Data Report (MDDR) database serve as a reference
	data set of known pharmacologically active compounds. All ligands
	were annotated according to the schemes when attribution was possible
	based on the activity classification provided by the reference database.
	The purpose of the ligand-target classification schemes is to allow
	annotation-based searching of the ligand database. In addition, the
	biological sequence information of the target is directly linkable
	to the ligand, hereby allowing sequence similarity-based identification
	of ligands of next homologous receptors. Ligands of specified levels
	can easily be retrieved to serve as comprehensive reference sets
	for cheminformatics-based similarity searches and for design of target
	class focused compound libraries. Retrospective in silico screening
	experiments within the MDDR01.1 database, searching for structures
	binding to dopamine D2, all dopamine receptors and all amine-binding
	class A GPCRs using known dopamine D2 binding compounds as a reference
	set, have shown that such reference sets are in particular useful
	for the identification of ligands binding to receptors closely related
	to the reference system. The potential for ligand identification
	drops with increasing phylogenetic distance. The analysis of the
	focus of a tertiary amine based combinatorial library compared to
	known amine binding class A GPCRs, peptide binding class A GPCRs,
	and LGIC ligands constitutes a second application scenario which
	illustrates how the focus of a combinatorial library can be treated
	quantitatively. The provided annotation schemes, which bridge chem-
	and bioinformatics by linking ligands to sequences, are expected

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have become
	an important tool in cell and molecular biology. Reliable design
	of siRNA molecules is essential for the needs of large functional
	genomics projects. RESULTS: To improve the design of efficient siRNA
	molecules, we performed a comparative, thermodynamic and correlation
	analysis on a heterogeneous set of 653 siRNAs collected from the
	literature. We used this training set to select siRNA features and
	optimize computational models. We identified 18 parameters that correlate
	significantly with silencing efficiency. Some of these parameters
	characterize only the siRNA sequence, while others involve the whole
	mRNA. Most importantly, we derived an siRNA position-dependent consensus,
	and optimized the free-energy difference of the 5' and 3' terminal
	dinucleotides of the siRNA antisense strand. The position-dependent
	consensus is based on correlation and t-test analyses of the training
	set, and accounts for both significantly preferred and avoided nucleotides
	in all sequence positions. On the training set, the two parameters'
	correlation with silencing efficiency was 0.5 and 0.36, respectively.
	Among other features, a dinucleotide content index and the frequency
	of potential targets for siRNA in the mRNA added predictive power
	to our model (R = 0.55). We showed that our model is effective for
	predicting the efficiency of siRNAs at different concentrations.
	We optimized a neural network model on our training set using three
	parameters characterizing the siRNA sequence, and predicted efficiencies
	for the test siRNA dataset recently published by Novartis. On this
	validation set, the correlation coefficient between predicted and
	observed efficiency was 0.75. Using the same model, we performed
	a transcriptome-wide analysis of optimal siRNA targets for 22,600
	human mRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that the properties of
	the siRNAs themselves are essential for efficient RNA interference.
	The 5' ends of antisense strands of efficient siRNAs are U-rich and
	possess a content similarity to the pyrimidine-rich oligonucleotides
	interacting with the polypurine RNA tracks that are recognized by
	RNase H. The advantage of our method over similar methods is the
	small number of parameters. As a result, our method requires a much
	smaller training set to produce consistent results. Other mRNA features,
	though expensive to compute, can slightly improve our model.},

	In this paper we present the details of PREDICT, a new algorithmic
	approach for modeling the 3D structure of GPCRs without relying on
	homology to rhodopsin. PREDICT, which focuses on the transmembrane
	domain of GPCRs, starts from the primary sequence of the receptor,
	simultaneously optimizing multiple 'decoy' conformations of the protein
	in order to find its most stable structure, culminating in a virtual
	receptor-ligand complex. In this paper we present a comprehensive
	analysis of three PREDICT models for the dopamine D2, neurokinin
	NK1, and neuropeptide Y Y1 receptors. A shorter discussion of the
	CCR3 receptor model is also included. All models were found to be
	in good agreement with a large body of experimental data. The quality
	of the PREDICT models, at least for drug discovery purposes, was
	evaluated by their successful utilization in in-silico screening.
	Virtual screening using all three PREDICT models yielded enrichment
	factors 9-fold to 44-fold better than random screening. Namely, the
	PREDICT models can be used to identify active small-molecule ligands

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: As the amount of biological sequence data continues to
	grow exponentially we face the increasing challenge of assigning
	function to this enormous molecular 'parts list'. The most popular
	approaches to this challenge make use of the simplifying assumption
	that similar functional molecules, or proteins, sometimes have similar
	composition, or sequence. However, these algorithms often fail to
	identify remote homologs (proteins with similar function but dissimilar
	sequence) which often are a significant fraction of the total homolog
	collection for a given sequence. We introduce a Support Vector Machine
	(SVM)-based tool to detect homology using semi-supervised iterative
	learning (SVM-HUSTLE) that identifies significantly more remote homologs
	than current state-of-the-art sequence or cluster-based methods.
	As opposed to building profiles or position specific scoring matrices,
	SVM-HUSTLE builds an SVM classifier for a query sequence by training
	on a collection of representative high-confidence training sets,
	recruits additional sequences and assigns a statistical measure of
	homology between a pair of sequences. SVM-HUSTLE combines principles
	of semi-supervised learning theory with statistical sampling to create
	many concurrent classifiers to iteratively detect and refine, on-the-fly,
	patterns indicating homology. RESULTS: When compared against existing
	methods for identifying protein homologs (BLAST, PSI-BLAST, COMPASS,
	PROF_SIM, RANKPROP and their variants) on two different benchmark
	datasets SVM-HUSTLE significantly outperforms each of the above methods
	using the most stringent ROC(1) statistic with P-values less than
	1e-20. SVM-HUSTLE also yields results comparable to HHSearch but
	at a substantially reduced computational cost since we do not require
	the construction of HMMs. AVAILABILITY: The software executable to

	the presence or absence of base signals and their spatial combinations.
	{O}ne of the best known examples of this is the signal identifying
	a core promoter-the site at which the basal transcription machinery
	starts the transcription of a gene. {O}ur goal is a fully automatic
	pattern recognition system for a family of sequences, which simultaneously
	discovers the base signals, their spatial relationships and a classifier
	based upon them. {RESULTS}: {I}n this paper we present a general
	method for characterizing a set of sequences by their recurrent motifs.
	{O}ur approach relies on novel probabilistic models for {DNA} binding
	sites and modules of binding sites, on algorithms to study them from
	the data and on a support vector machine that uses the models studied
	to classify a set of sequences. {W}e demonstrate the applicability

	sequences to a dataset of intronic sequences flanking alternatively

  abstract = {Here, we present an approach for the prediction of binding preferences
	of members of a large protein family for which structural information
	for a number of family members bound to a substrate is available.
	The approach involves a number of steps. First, an accurate multiple
	alignment of sequences of all members of a protein family is constructed
	on the basis of a multiple structural superposition of family members
	with known structure. Second, the methods of continuum electrostatics
	are used to characterize the energetic contribution of each residue
	in a protein to the binding of its substrate. Residues that make
	a significant contribution are mapped onto the protein sequence and
	are used to define a "binding site signature" for the complex being
	considered. Third, sequences whose structures have not been determined
	are checked to see if they have binding-site signatures similar to
	one of the known complexes. Predictions of binding affinity to a
	given substrate are based on similarities in binding-site signature.
	An important component of the approach is the introduction of a context-specific
	substitution matrix suitable for comparison of binding-site residues.The
	methods are applied to the prediction of phosphopeptide selectivity
	of SH2 domains. To this end, the energetic roles of all protein residues
	in 17 different complexes of SH2 domains with their cognate targets
	are analyzed. The total number of residues that make significant
	contributions to binding is found to vary from nine to 19 in different
	complexes. These energetically important residues are found to contribute
	to binding through a variety of mechanisms, involving both electrostatic
	and hydrophobic interactions. Binding-site signatures are found to
	involve residues in different positions in SH2 sequences, some of
	them as far as 9A away from a bound peptide. Surprisingly, similarities
	in the signatures of different domains do not correlate with whole-domain
	sequence identities unless the latter is greater than 50\%.An extensive
	comparison with the optimal binding motifs determined by peptide
	library experiments, as well as other experimental data indicate
	that the similarity in binding preferences of different SH2 domains
	can be deduced on the basis of their binding-site signatures. The
	analysis provides a rationale for the empirically derived classification
	of SH2 domains described by Songyang & Cantley, in that proteins
	in the same group are found to have similar residues at positions
	important for binding. Confident predictions of binding preference
	can be made for about 85\% of SH2 domain sequences found in SWISSPROT.
	The approach described in this work is quite general and can, in
	principle, be used to analyze binding preferences of members of large
	protein families for which structural information for a number of
	family members is available. It also offers a strategy for predicting
	cross-reactivity of compounds designed to bind to a particular target,
	for example in structure-based drug design.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: An increasing number of studies have profiled tumor specimens
	using distinct microarray platforms and analysis techniques. With
	the accumulating amount of microarray data, one of the most intriguing
	yet challenging tasks is to develop robust statistical models to
	integrate the findings. RESULTS: By applying a two-stage Bayesian
	mixture modeling strategy, we were able to assimilate and analyze
	four independent microarray studies to derive an inter-study validated
	"meta-signature" associated with breast cancer prognosis. Combining
	multiple studies (n = 305 samples) on a common probability scale,
	we developed a 90-gene meta-signature, which strongly associated
	with survival in breast cancer patients. Given the set of independent
	studies using different microarray platforms which included spotted
	cDNAs, Affymetrix GeneChip, and inkjet oligonucleotides, the individually
	identified classifiers yielded gene sets predictive of survival in
	each study cohort. The study-specific gene signatures, however, had
	minimal overlap with each other, and performed poorly in pairwise
	cross-validation. The meta-signature, on the other hand, accommodated
	such heterogeneity and achieved comparable or better prognostic performance
	when compared with the individual signatures. Further by comparing
	to a global standardization method, the mixture model based data
	transformation demonstrated superior properties for data integration
	and provided solid basis for building classifiers at the second stage.
	Functional annotation revealed that genes involved in cell cycle
	and signal transduction activities were over-represented in the meta-signature.
	CONCLUSION: The mixture modeling approach unifies disparate gene
	expression data on a common probability scale allowing for robust,
	inter-study validated prognostic signatures to be obtained. With
	the emerging utility of microarrays for cancer prognosis, it will
	be important to establish paradigms to meta-analyze disparate gene
	expression data for prognostic signatures of potential clinical use.},

	samples in maximizing the log-likelihood function. This approach
	is effective in cases such as sample surveys or design of experiments,
	where the observed covariate follows a different distribution than
	that in the whole population. Under misspecification of the parametric
	model, the optimal choice of the weight function is asymptotically
	shown to be the ratio of the density function of the covariate in
	the population to that in the observations. This is the pseudo-maximum
	likelihood estimation of sample surveys. The optimality is defined
	by the expected Kullback\&\#x2013;Leibler loss, and the optimal weight
	is obtained by considering the importance sampling identity. Under
	correct specification of the model, however, the ordinary maximum
	likelihood estimate (i.e. the uniform weight) is shown to be optimal
	asymptotically. For moderate sample size, the situation is in between
	the two extreme cases, and the weight function is selected by minimizing
	a variant of the information criterion derived as an estimate of
	the expected loss. The method is also applied to a weighted version
	of the Bayesian predictive density. Numerical examples as well as
	Monte-Carlo simulations are shown for polynomial regression. A connection
	with the robust parametric estimation is discussed.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {10 Suppl 9},
  pages = {S17},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The ability to predict drug sensitivity in cancer is one
	of the exciting promises of pharmacogenomic research. Several groups
	have demonstrated the ability to predict drug sensitivity by integrating
	chemo-sensitivity data and associated gene expression measurements
	from large anti-cancer drug screens such as NCI-60. The general approach
	is based on comparing gene expression measurements from sensitive
	and resistant cancer cell lines and deriving drug sensitivity profiles
	consisting of lists of genes whose expression is predictive of response
	to a drug. Importantly, it has been shown that such profiles are
	generic and can be applied to cancer cell lines that are not part
	of the anti-cancer screen. However, one limitation is that the profiles
	can not be generated for untested drugs (i.e., drugs that are not
	part of an anti-cancer drug screen). In this work, we propose using
	an existing drug sensitivity profile for drug A as a substitute for
	an untested drug B given high structural similarities between drugs
	A and B. RESULTS: We first show that structural similarity between
	pairs of compounds in the NCI-60 dataset highly correlates with the
	similarity between their activities across the cancer cell lines.
	This result shows that structurally similar drugs can be expected
	to have a similar effect on cancer cell lines. We next set out to
	test our hypothesis that we can use existing drug sensitivity profiles
	as substitute profiles for untested drugs. In a cross-validation
	experiment, we found that the use of substitute profiles is possible
	without a significant loss of prediction accuracy if the substitute
	profile was generated from a compound with high structural similarity
	to the untested compound. CONCLUSION: Anti-cancer drug screens are
	a valuable resource for generating omics-based drug sensitivity profiles.
	We show that it is possible to extend the usefulness of existing
	screens to untested drugs by deriving substitute sensitivity profiles
	from structurally similar drugs part of the screen.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The rate of mRNA decay is an essential element of post-transcriptional
	regulation in all organisms. Previously, studies in several organisms
	found that the specific half-life of each mRNA is precisely related
	to its physiologic role, and plays an important role in determining
	levels of gene expression. RESULTS: We used a genome-wide approach
	to characterize mRNA decay in Plasmodium falciparum. We found that,
	globally, rates of mRNA decay increase dramatically during the asexual
	intra-erythrocytic developmental cycle. During the ring stage of
	the cycle, the average mRNA half-life was 9.5 min, but this was extended
	to an average of 65 min during the late schizont stage of development.
	Thus, a major determinant of mRNA decay rate appears to be linked
	to the stage of intra-erythrocytic development. Furthermore, we found
	specific variations in decay patterns superimposed upon the dominant
	trend of progressive half-life lengthening. These variations in decay
	pattern were frequently enriched for genes with specific cellular
	functions or processes. CONCLUSION: Elucidation of Plasmodium mRNA
	decay rates provides a key element for deciphering mechanisms of
	genetic control in this parasite, by complementing and extending
	previous mRNA abundance studies. Our results indicate that progressive
	stage-dependent decreases in mRNA decay rate function are a major
	determinant of mRNA accumulation during the schizont stage of intra-erythrocytic
	development. This type of genome-wide change in mRNA decay rate has
	not been observed in any other organism to date, and indicates that
	post-transcriptional regulation may be the dominant mechanism of
	gene regulation in P. falciparum.},

	preventing the aggregation and insolubility of most natural {beta}-sheet
	proteins. {S}uch mechanisms are unfavorable in the interior of a
	{beta}-sheet. {T}he problem of distinguishing edge strands from central
	strands based on sequence information alone is important in predicting
	residues and mutations likely to be involved in aggregation, and
	is also a first step in predicting folding topology. {H}ere we report
	support vector machine ({SVM}) and decision tree methods developed
	to classify edge strands from central strands in a representative
	set of protein domains. {I}nterestingly, rules generated by the decision
	tree method are in close agreement with our knowledge of protein
	structure and are potentially useful in a number of different biological
	applications. {W}hen trained on strands from proteins of known structure,
	using structure-based ({D}ictionary of {S}econdary {S}tructure in
	{P}roteins) strand assignments, both methods achieved mean cross-validated,
	prediction accuracies of ~78%. {T}hese accuracies were reduced when
	strand assignments from secondary structure prediction were used.
	{F}urther investigation of this effect revealed that it could be
	explained by a significant reduction in the accuracy of standard
	secondary structure prediction methods for edge strands, in comparison
	with central strands.},

  abstract = {Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) and their networks play a central
	role in all biological processes. Akin to the complete sequencing
	of genomes and their comparative analysis, complete descriptions
	of interactomes and their comparative analysis is fundamental to
	a deeper understanding of biological processes. A first step in such
	an analysis is to align two or more PPI networks. Here, we introduce
	an algorithm, IsoRank, for global alignment of multiple PPI networks.
	The guiding intuition here is that a protein in one PPI network is
	a good match for a protein in another network if their respective
	sequences and neighborhood topologies are a good match. We encode
	this intuition as an eigenvalue problem in a manner analogous to
	Google's PageRank method. Using IsoRank, we compute a global alignment
	of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabditis
	elegans, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens PPI networks. We demonstrate
	that incorporating PPI data in ortholog prediction results in improvements
	over existing sequence-only approaches and over predictions from
	local alignments of the yeast and fly networks. Previous methods
	have been effective at identifying conserved, localized network patterns
	across pairs of networks. This work takes the further step of performing
	a global alignment of multiple PPI networks. It simultaneously uses
	sequence similarity and network data and, unlike previous approaches,
	explicitly models the tradeoff inherent in combining them. We expect
	IsoRank-with its simultaneous handling of node similarity and network
	similarity-to be applicable across many scientific domains.},

	gene duplication, speciation and other processes. As a number of
	studies have shown, standard methods of protein function prediction
	produce systematic errors on these data. Phylogenomic analysis--combining
	phylogenetic tree construction, integration of experimental data
	and differentiation of orthologs and paralogs--has been proposed
	to address these errors and improve the accuracy of functional classification.
	The explicit integration of structure prediction and analysis in
	this framework, which we call structural phylogenomics, provides
	additional insights into protein superfamily evolution. RESULTS:
	Results of protein functional classification using phylogenomic analysis
	show fewer expected false positives overall than when pairwise methods
	of functional classification are employed. We present an overview
	of the motivations and fundamental principles of phylogenomic analysis,
	new methods developed for the key tasks, benchmark datasets for these
	tasks (when available) and suggest procedures to increase accuracy.
	We also discuss some of the methods used in the Celera Genomics high-throughput

	for gene transcription, phosphorylation, cell morphology and drug
	perturbations, and used to explain various aspects of cellular physiology.
	In all cases, however, the causes of heterogeneity were not studied.
	Here we analyse, for the first time, the heterogeneous patterns of
	related cellular activities, namely virus infection, endocytosis

	correlations with specific cellular states that are defined by the

	activities, solely on the basis of each cell's population context.
	We find that accounting for population-determined heterogeneity is
	essential for interpreting differences between the activity levels
	of cell populations. Finally, we reveal that synergy between two
	molecular components, focal adhesion kinase and the sphingolipid
	GM1, enhances the population-determined pattern of simian virus 40

  abstract = {It has been recognized that drug-induced QT prolongation is related
	to blockage of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) ion channel.
	Therefore, it is prudent to evaluate the hERG binding of active compounds
	in early stages of drug discovery. In silico approaches provide an
	economic and quick method to screen for potential hERG liability.
	A diverse set of 90 compounds with hERG IC(50) inhibition data was
	collected from literature references. Fragment-based QSAR descriptors
	and three different statistical methods, support vector regression,
	partial least squares, and random forests, were employed to construct
	QSAR models for hERG binding affinity. Important fragment descriptors
	relevant to hERG binding affinity were identified through an efficient
	feature selection method based on sparse linear support vector regression.
	The support vector regression predictive model built upon selected
	fragment descriptors outperforms the other two statistical methods
	in this study, resulting in an r(2) of 0.912 and 0.848 for the training
	and testing data sets, respectively. The support vector regression
	model was applied to predict hERG binding affinities of 20 in-house
	compounds belonging to three different series. The model predicted
	the relative binding affinity well for two out of three compound
	series. The hierarchical clustering and dendrogram results show that
	the compound series with the best prediction has much higher structural
	similarity and more neighbors of training compounds than the other
	two compound series, demonstrating the predictive scope of the model.
	The combination of a QSAR model and postprocessing analysis, such
	as clustering and visualization, provides a way to assess the confidence
	level of QSAR prediction results on the basis of similarity to the
	training set.},

	variability in protein concentrations. In mammalian cells, protein
	levels also vary and individual cells differ widely in their responsiveness
	to uniform physiological stimuli. In the case of apoptosis mediated
	by TRAIL (tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-inducing
	ligand) it is common for some cells in a clonal population to die
	while others survive-a striking divergence in cell fate. Among cells
	that die, the time between TRAIL exposure and caspase activation
	is highly variable. Here we image sister cells expressing reporters
	of caspase activation and mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization
	after exposure to TRAIL. We show that naturally occurring differences
	in the levels or states of proteins regulating receptor-mediated
	apoptosis are the primary causes of cell-to-cell variability in the
	timing and probability of death in human cell lines. Protein state
	is transmitted from mother to daughter, giving rise to transient
	heritability in fate, but protein synthesis promotes rapid divergence
	so that sister cells soon become no more similar to each other than
	pairs of cells chosen at random. Our results have implications for
	understanding 'fractional killing' of tumour cells after exposure

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: High-throughput sequencing technology has become popular
	and widely used to study protein and DNA interactions. Chromatin
	immunoprecipitation, followed by sequencing of the resulting samples,
	produces large amounts of data that can be used to map genomic features
	such as transcription factor binding sites and histone modifications.
	METHODS: Our proposed statistical algorithm, BayesPeak, uses a fully
	Bayesian hidden Markov model to detect enriched locations in the
	genome. The structure accommodates the natural features of the Solexa/Illumina
	sequencing data and allows for overdispersion in the abundance of
	reads in different regions. Moreover, a control sample can be incorporated
	in the analysis to account for experimental and sequence biases.
	Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms are applied to estimate the posterior
	distributions of the model parameters, and posterior probabilities
	are used to detect the sites of interest. CONCLUSION: We have presented
	a flexible approach for identifying peaks from ChIP-seq reads, suitable
	for use on both transcription factor binding and histone modification
	data. Our method estimates probabilities of enrichment that can be
	used in downstream analysis. The method is assessed using experimentally
	verified data and is shown to provide high-confidence calls with
	low false positive rates.},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},

  pages = {57},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: As the use of microarray technology becomes more prevalent
	it is not unusual to find several laboratories employing the same
	microarray technology to identify genes related to the same condition
	in the same species. Although the experimental specifics are similar,
	typically a different list of statistically significant genes result
	from each data analysis. RESULTS: We propose a statistically-based
	meta-analytic approach to microarray analysis for the purpose of
	systematically combining results from the different laboratories.
	This approach provides a more precise view of genes that are significantly
	related to the condition of interest while simultaneously allowing
	for differences between laboratories. Of particular interest is the
	widely used Affymetrix oligonucleotide array, the results of which
	are naturally suited to a meta-analysis. A simulation model based
	on the Affymetrix platform is developed to examine the adaptive nature
	of the meta-analytic approach and to illustrate the usefulness of
	such an approach in combining microarray results across laboratories.
	The approach is then applied to real data involving a mouse model
	for multiple sclerosis. CONCLUSION: The quantitative estimates from
	the meta-analysis model tend to be closer to the "true" degree of
	differential expression than any single lab. Meta-analytic methods
	can systematically combine Affymetrix results from different laboratories
	to gain a clearer understanding of genes' relationships to specific
	conditions of interest.},

	inhibits active caspases implies that not each caspase activation
	necessarily leads to apoptosis. In such a scenario, however, processed
	and enzymically active caspases should somehow be removed. Indeed,
	IAP-caspase complexes covalently bind ubiquitin, resulting in degradation
	by the 26S proteasome. Following release from mitochondria, IAP antagonists
	(e.g. second mitochondrial activator of caspases (Smac)) inactivate
	IAPs. Moreover, although pro-apoptotic factors such as irradiation
	or anti-cancer drugs may release Smac from mitochondria in tumor
	cells, high cytoplasmic survivin and ML-IAP levels might be able
	to neutralize it and, consequently, IAPs would further be able to

	{H}owever, their value in cancer detection has been controversial
	largely because no single tumor marker is sensitive and specific
	enough to meet strict diagnostic criteria. {O}ne strategy to overcome
	the shortcomings of single tumor markers is to measure a combination
	of tumor markers to increase sensitivity and look for distinct patterns
	to increase specificity. {T}his study aimed to develop a system for
	parallel detection of tumor markers as a tool for tumor detection
	in both cancer patients and asymptomatic populations at high risk.
	{MATERIALS} {AND} {METHODS}: {A} protein chip was fabricated with
	twelve monoclonal antibodies against the following tumor markers
	respectively: {CA}125, {CA}15-3, {CA}19-9, {CA}242, {CEA}, {AFP},
	{PSA}, free-{PSA}, {HGH}, beta-{HCG}, {NSE} and ferritin. {T}umor
	markers were captured after the protein chip was incubated with serum
	samples. {A} secondary antibody conjugated with {HRP} was used to
	detect the captured tumor markers using chemiluminescence technique.
	{Q}uantification of the tumor markers was obtained after calibration
	with standard curves. {RESULTS}: {T}he chip system showed an overall
	sensitivity of 68.18\% after testing 1147 cancer patients, with high
	sensitivities for liver, pancreas and ovarian tumors and low sensitivities
	for gastrointestinal tumors, and a specificity of 97.1\% after testing
	793 healthy individuals. {A}pplication of the chip system in physical
	checkups of 15,867 individuals resulted in 16 cases that were subsequently
	confirmed as having cancers. {A}nalysis of the detection results
	with a {S}upport {V}ector {M}achine algorithm considerably increased
	the specificity of the system as reflected in healthy individuals
	and hepatitis/cirrhosis patients, but only modestly decreased the
	sensitivity for cancer patients. {CONCLUSION}: {T}his protein chip
	system is a potential tool for assisting cancer diagnosis and for
	screening cancer in high-risk populations.},

	cellular factors that bind to the HIV-1 long terminal repeat, including
	NF-kappaB, SP1, LBP, and LEF, are also important in the control of
	HIV-1 gene expression. Although these factors have been demonstrated
	to regulate HIV-1 gene expression by both genetic and biochemical

	of RNA interference in mammalian cells has been shown utilizing small

	host mRNAs and decreases the levels of their corresponding proteins.
	In this study, we addressed whether siRNAs directed against either
	HIV-1 tat or reverse transcriptase or the NF-kappaB p65 subunit could
	specifically decrease the levels of these proteins and thus alter
	HIV-1 replication. Our results demonstrate the specificity of siRNAs

	on variations in gene expression patterns derived from cDNA microarrays
	and to correlate tumor characteristics to clinical outcome. A total
	of 85 cDNA microarray experiments representing 78 cancers, three
	fibroadenomas, and four normal breast tissues were analyzed by hierarchical
	clustering. As reported previously, the cancers could be classified
	into a basal epithelial-like group, an ERBB2-overexpressing group
	and a normal breast-like group based on variations in gene expression.
	A novel finding was that the previously characterized luminal epithelial/estrogen
	receptor-positive group could be divided into at least two subgroups,
	each with a distinctive expression profile. These subtypes proved
	to be reasonably robust by clustering using two different gene sets:
	first, a set of 456 cDNA clones previously selected to reflect intrinsic

	to be reasonably robust by clustering using two different gene sets:

  abstract = {O{BJECTIVE}:: {P}rotein homology prediction between protein sequences
	is one of critical problems in computational biology. {S}uch a complex
	classification problem is common in medical or biological information
	processing applications. {H}ow to build a model with superior generalization
	capability from training samples is an essential issue for mining
	knowledge to accurately predict/classify unseen new samples and to
	effectively support human experts to make correct decisions. {METHODOLOGY}::
	{A} new learning model called granular support vector machines ({GSVM})
	is proposed based on our previous work. {GSVM} systematically and
	formally combines the principles from statistical learning theory
	and granular computing theory and thus provides an interesting new
	mechanism to address complex classification problems. {I}t works
	by building a sequence of information granules and then building
	support vector machines ({SVM}) in some of these information granules
	on demand. {A} good granulation method to find suitable granules
	is crucial for modeling a {GSVM} with good performance. {I}n this
	paper, we also propose an association rules-based granulation method.
	{F}or the granules induced by association rules with high enough
	confidence and significant support, we leave them as they are because
	of their high "purity" and significant effect on simplifying the
	classification task. {F}or every other granule, a {SVM} is modeled
	to discriminate the corresponding data. {I}n this way, a complex
	classification problem is divided into multiple smaller problems
	so that the learning task is simplified. {RESULTS} {AND} {CONCLUSIONS}::
	{T}he proposed algorithm, here named {GSVM}-{AR}, is compared with
	{SVM} by {KDDCUP}04 protein homology prediction data. {T}he experimental
	results show that finding the splitting hyperplane is not a trivial
	task (we should be careful to select the association rules to avoid
	overfitting) and {GSVM}-{AR} does show significant improvement compared
	to building one single {SVM} in the whole feature space. {A}nother
	advantage is that the utility of {GSVM}-{AR} is very good because
	it is easy to be implemented. {M}ore importantly and more interestingly,
	{GSVM} provides a new mechanism to address complex classification

	problem of a logical description is to find an adequate way to involve
	time. {T}he procedure we adopted differs radically from the classical
	one by its fully asynchronous character. {I}n {S}ec. {II} we describe
	our "naive" logical approach, and use it to illustrate the major
	laws of circuitry (namely, the involvement of positive circuits in
	multistationarity and of negative circuits in periodicity) and in
	a biological example. {A}lready in the naive description, the major
	steps of the logical description are to: (i) describe a model as
	a set of logical equations, (ii) derive the state table from the
	equations, (iii) derive the graph of the sequences of states from
	the state table, and (iv) determine which of the possible pathways
	will be actually followed in terms of time delays. {I}n the following
	sections we consider multivalued variables where required, the introduction
	of logical parameters and of logical values ascribed to the thresholds,
	and the concept of characteristic state of a circuit. {T}his generalized
	logical description provides an image whose qualitative fit with
	the differential description is quite remarkable. {A} major interest
	of the generalized logical description is that it implies a limited
	and often quite small number of possible combinations of values of
	the logical parameters. {T}he space of the logical parameters is
	thus cut into a limited number of boxes, each of which is characterized
	by a defined qualitative behavior of the system. {O}ur analysis tells
	which constraints on the logical parameters must be fulfilled in
	order for any circuit (or combination of circuits) to be functional.
	{F}unctionality of a circuit will result in multistationarity (in
	the case of a positive circuit) or in a cycle (in the case of a negative
	circuit). {T}he last sections deal with "more about time delays"

	containing 17 known disease genes. We successfully select the known
	disease gene for 15 out of 17 diseases and reduce the candidate gene
	set to 63.3\% (+/-18.8\%) of its original size. This approach facilitates

	The structural interactions patterns of peptide/HLA class I complexes

	AL. Crystal structures of a second G protein-coupled receptor: triumphs

	subclasses of GPCR proteins, the hallmark of all GPCR proteins is
	the transmembrane-spanning region. The general architecture of this
	transmembrane (TM) region has been known for some time to contain
	seven alpha-helices. From a drug discovery and design perspective,
	structural information of the GPCRs has been sought as a tool for
	structure-based drug design. The advances in the past decade of technologies
	for structure-based design have proven to be useful in a number of
	areas. Invoking these approaches for GPCR targets has remained challenging.
	Until recently, the most closely related structures available for
	GPCR modeling have been those of bovine rhodopsin. While a representative
	of class A GPCRs, bovine rhodopsin is not a ligand-activated GPCR
	and is fairly distant in sequence homology to other class A GPCRs.
	Thus, there is a variable degree of uncertainty in the use of the
	rhodopsin X-ray structure as a template for homology modeling of
	other GPCR targets. Recent publications of X-ray structures of class
	A GPCRs now offer the opportunity to better understand the molecular
	mechanism of action at the atomic level, to deploy X-ray structures
	directly for their use in structure-based design, and to provide
	more promising templates for many other ligand-mediated GPCRs. We
	summarize herein some of the recent findings in this area and provide
	an initial perspective of the emerging opportunities, possible limitations,
	and remaining questions. Other aspects of the recent X-ray structures

	are often well represented by a Boolean model with a family of logical
	rules. The state space of a Boolean model is finite, and its asynchronous
	dynamics are fully described by a transition graph in the state space.
	In this context, a model reduction method will be developed for identifying
	the active or operational interactions responsible for a given dynamic
	behaviour. The first step in this procedure is the decomposition
	of the asynchronous transition graph into its strongly connected
	components, to obtain a reduced and hierarchically organized graph
	of transitions. The second step consists of the identification of
	a partial graph of interactions and a sub-family of logical rules
	that remain operational in a given region of the state space. This
	model reduction method and its usefulness are illustrated by an application
	to a model of programmed cell death. The method identifies two mechanisms
	used by the cell to respond to death-receptor stimulation and decide
	between the survival and apoptotic pathways.},

	relied on a gene's nucleotide composition, obviated the need for

	to perform very well across a wide range of archaeal and bacterial

	While recent progress in machine learning has mainly focused on designing

	can deal with more complex outputs, such as trees, sequences, or

	exponential, number of constraints, we present a cutting plane algorithm

	acid resistance are unknown. The acid-induced genes represented only
	five functional grouping categories, including eight genes involved
	in metabolism, nine associated with cell envelope structures or modifications,
	two encoding chaperones, six regulatory genes, and six unknown genes.
	It is unlikely that all of these genes are involved in the glutamate-dependent
	AR. However, nine acid-inducible genes are clustered in the gadA
	region, including hdeA, which encodes a putative periplasmic chaperone,
	and four putative regulatory genes. One of these putative regulators,
	yhiE, was shown to significantly increase acid resistance when overexpressed
	in cells that had not been preinduced by growth at pH 5.5, and mutation
	of yhiE decreased acid resistance; yhiE could therefore encode an
	activator of AR genes. Thus, the acid-inducible genes clustered in
	the gadA region appear to be involved in glutatmate-dependent acid
	resistance, although their specific roles remain to be elucidated.},

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Both modeling of antigen-processing pathway including
	major histocompatibility complex (MHC) binding and immunogenicity
	prediction of those MHC-binding peptides are essential to develop
	a computer-aided system of peptide-based vaccine design that is one
	goal of immunoinformatics. Numerous studies have dealt with modeling
	the immunogenic pathway but not the intractable problem of immunogenicity
	prediction due to complex effects of many intrinsic and extrinsic
	factors. Moderate affinity of the MHC-peptide complex is essential
	to induce immune responses, but the relationship between the affinity
	and peptide immunogenicity is too weak to use for predicting immunogenicity.
	This study focuses on mining informative physicochemical properties
	from known experimental immunogenicity data to understand immune
	responses and predict immunogenicity of MHC-binding peptides accurately.
	RESULTS: This study proposes a computational method to mine a feature
	set of informative physicochemical properties from MHC class I binding
	peptides to design a support vector machine (SVM) based system (named
	POPI) for the prediction of peptide immunogenicity. High performance
	of POPI arises mainly from an inheritable bi-objective genetic algorithm,
	which aims to automatically determine the best number m out of 531
	physicochemical properties, identify these m properties and tune
	SVM parameters simultaneously. The dataset consisting of 428 human
	MHC class I binding peptides belonging to four classes of immunogenicity
	was established from MHCPEP, a database of MHC-binding peptides (Brusic
	et al., 1998). POPI, utilizing the m = 23 selected properties, performs
	well with the accuracy of 64.72\% using leave-one-out cross-validation,
	compared with two sequence alignment-based prediction methods ALIGN
	(54.91\%) and PSI-BLAST (53.23\%). POPI is the first computational
	system for prediction of peptide immunogenicity based on physicochemical
	properties. AVAILABILITY: A web server for prediction of peptide

  abstract = {O{BJECTIVE}: {A}cute lymphoblastic leukemia ({ALL}) is the most common
	malignancy of childhood, representing nearly one third of all pediatric
	cancers. {C}urrently, the treatment of pediatric {ALL} is centered
	on tailoring the intensity of the therapy applied to a patient's
	risk of relapse, which is linked to the type of leukemia the patient
	has. {H}ence, accurate and correct diagnosis of the various leukemia
	subtypes becomes an important first step in the treatment process.
	{R}ecently, gene expression profiling using {DNA} microarrays has
	been shown to be a viable and accurate diagnostic tool to identify
	the known prognostically important {ALL} subtypes. {T}hus, there
	is currently a huge interest in developing autonomous classification
	systems for cancer diagnosis using gene expression data. {T}his is
	to achieve an unbiased analysis of the data and also partly to handle
	the large amount of genetic information extracted from the {DNA}
	microarrays. {METHODOLOGY}: {G}enerally, existing medical decision
	support systems ({DSS}) for cancer classification and diagnosis are
	based on traditional statistical methods such as {B}ayesian decision
	theory and machine learning models such as neural networks ({NN})
	and support vector machine ({SVM}). {T}hough high accuracies have
	been reported for these systems, they fall short on certain critical
	areas. {T}hese included (a) being able to present the extracted knowledge
	and explain the computed solutions to the users; (b) having a logical
	deduction process that is similar and intuitive to the human reasoning
	process; and (c) flexible enough to incorporate new knowledge without
	running the risk of eroding old but valid information. {O}n the other
	hand, a neural fuzzy system, which is synthesized to emulate the
	human ability to learn and reason in the presence of imprecise and
	incomplete information, has the ability to overcome the above-mentioned
	shortcomings. {H}owever, existing neural fuzzy systems have their
	own limitations when used in the design and implementation of {DSS}.
	{H}ence, this paper proposed the use of a novel neural fuzzy system:
	the generic self-organising fuzzy neural network ({G}en{S}o{FNN})
	with truth-value restriction ({TVR}) fuzzy inference, as a fuzzy
	{DSS} (denoted as {G}en{S}o-{FDSS}) for the classification of {ALL}
	subtypes using gene expression data. {RESULTS} {AND} {CONCLUSION}:
	{T}he performance of the {G}en{S}o-{FDSS} system is encouraging when
	benchmarked against those of {NN}, {SVM} and the {K}-nearest neighbor
	({K}-{NN}) classifier. {O}n average, a classification rate of above
	90\% has been achieved using the {G}en{S}o-{FDSS} system.},

	as measured by the number of rotatable bonds, and low polar surface

	found to be important predictors of good oral bioavailability, independent
	of molecular weight. That on average both the number of rotatable

	with molecular weight may in part explain the success of the molecular
	weight parameter in predicting oral bioavailability. The commonly
	applied molecular weight cutoff at 500 does not itself significantly
	separate compounds with poor oral bioavailability from those with
	acceptable values in this extensive data set. Our observations suggest
	that compounds which meet only the two criteria of (1) 10 or fewer
	rotatable bonds and (2) polar surface area equal to or less than
	140 A(2) (or 12 or fewer H-bond donors and acceptors) will have a
	high probability of good oral bioavailability in the rat. Data sets
	for the artificial membrane permeation rate and for clearance in
	the rat were also examined. Reduced polar surface area correlates
	better with increased permeation rate than does lipophilicity (C
	log P), and increased rotatable bond count has a negative effect
	on the permeation rate. A threshold permeation rate is a prerequisite
	of oral bioavailability. The rotatable bond count does not correlate

  abstract = {Breast cancer patients with the same stage of disease can have markedly
	different treatment responses and overall outcome. The strongest
	predictors for metastases (for example, lymph node status and histological
	grade) fail to classify accurately breast tumours according to their
	clinical behaviour. Chemotherapy or hormonal therapy reduces the
	risk of distant metastases by approximately one-third; however, 70-80\%
	of patients receiving this treatment would have survived without
	it. None of the signatures of breast cancer gene expression reported
	to date allow for patient-tailored therapy strategies. Here we used
	DNA microarray analysis on primary breast tumours of 117 young patients,
	and applied supervised classification to identify a gene expression
	signature strongly predictive of a short interval to distant metastases
	('poor prognosis' signature) in patients without tumour cells in
	local lymph nodes at diagnosis (lymph node negative). In addition,
	we established a signature that identifies tumours of BRCA1 carriers.
	The poor prognosis signature consists of genes regulating cell cycle,
	invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis. This gene expression profile
	will outperform all currently used clinical parameters in predicting
	disease outcome. Our findings provide a strategy to select patients
	who would benefit from adjuvant therapy.},

	{T}he public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a
	2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced,

	used by the publicly funded group. {T}his brought the effective coverage

	effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes.
	{M}ore than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2006},
  volume = {7},
  pages = {520},
  abstract = {Background
	
	The use of exogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) for gene silencing
	has quickly become a widespread molecular tool providing a powerful
	means for gene functional study and new drug target identification.
	Although considerable progress has been made recently in understanding
	how the RNAi pathway mediates gene silencing, the design of potent
	siRNAs remains challenging.
	
	
	Results
	
	We propose a simple linear model combining basic features of siRNA
	sequences for siRNA efficacy prediction. Trained and tested on a
	large dataset of siRNA sequences made recently available, it performs
	as well as more complex state-of-the-art models in terms of potency
	prediction accuracy, with the advantage of being directly interpretable.
	The analysis of this linear model allows us to detect and quantify
	the effect of nucleotide preferences at particular positions, including
	previously known and new observations. We also detect and quantify
	a strong propensity of potent siRNAs to contain short asymmetric
	motifs in their sequence, and show that, surprisingly, these motifs
	alone contain at least as much relevant information for potency prediction
	as the nucleotide preferences for particular positions.
	
	
	Conclusion
	
	The model proposed for prediction of siRNA potency is as accurate
	as a state-of-the-art nonlinear model and is easily interpretable
	in terms of biological features. It is freely available on the web
	at http://cbio.ensmp.fr/dsir},

  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {8 Suppl 10},
  pages = {S8},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Much recent work in bioinformatics has focused on the
	inference of various types of biological networks, representing gene
	regulation, metabolic processes, protein-protein interactions, etc.
	A common setting involves inferring network edges in a supervised
	fashion from a set of high-confidence edges, possibly characterized
	by multiple, heterogeneous data sets (protein sequence, gene expression,
	etc.). RESULTS: Here, we distinguish between two modes of inference
	in this setting: direct inference based upon similarities between
	nodes joined by an edge, and indirect inference based upon similarities
	between one pair of nodes and another pair of nodes. We propose a
	supervised approach for the direct case by translating it into a
	distance metric learning problem. A relaxation of the resulting convex
	optimization problem leads to the support vector machine (SVM) algorithm
	with a particular kernel for pairs, which we call the metric learning
	pairwise kernel. This new kernel for pairs can easily be used by
	most SVM implementations to solve problems of supervised classification
	and inference of pairwise relationships from heterogeneous data.
	We demonstrate, using several real biological networks and genomic
	datasets, that this approach often improves upon the state-of-the-art
	SVM for indirect inference with another pairwise kernel, and that
	the combination of both kernels always improves upon each individual
	kernel. CONCLUSION: The metric learning pairwise kernel is a new
	formulation to infer pairwise relationships with SVM, which provides
	state-of-the-art results for the inference of several biological
	networks from heterogeneous genomic data.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A more accurate means of prognostication in breast cancer
	will improve the selection of patients for adjuvant systemic therapy.
	METHODS: Using microarray analysis to evaluate our previously established
	70-gene prognosis profile, we classified a series of 295 consecutive
	patients with primary breast carcinomas as having a gene-expression
	signature associated with either a poor prognosis or a good prognosis.
	All patients had stage I or II breast cancer and were younger than
	53 years old; 151 had lymph-node-negative disease, and 144 had lymph-node-positive
	disease. We evaluated the predictive power of the prognosis profile
	using univariable and multivariable statistical analyses. RESULTS:
	Among the 295 patients, 180 had a poor-prognosis signature and 115
	had a good-prognosis signature, and the mean (+/-SE) overall 10-year
	survival rates were 54.6+/-4.4 percent and 94.5+/-2.6 percent, respectively.
	At 10 years, the probability of remaining free of distant metastases
	was 50.6+/-4.5 percent in the group with a poor-prognosis signature
	and 85.2+/-4.3 percent in the group with a good-prognosis signature.
	The estimated hazard ratio for distant metastases in the group with
	a poor-prognosis signature, as compared with the group with the good-prognosis
	signature, was 5.1 (95 percent confidence interval, 2.9 to 9.0; P<0.001).
	This ratio remained significant when the groups were analyzed according
	to lymph-node status. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed
	that the prognosis profile was a strong independent factor in predicting
	disease outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The gene-expression profile we studied
	is a more powerful predictor of the outcome of disease in young patients
	with breast cancer than standard systems based on clinical and histologic
	criteria.},

	do not provide precise confidence estimates for their predictions.
	{RESULTS}: {W}e have developed a large-scale annotation system that

	the 1q gain/16q loss combination observed in 3 luminal DCIS, the
	mixed amplifier pattern including all ERBB2, 12 luminal and 2 ERBB2(-)/ER(-)
	DCIS, and the complex copy number alteration profile encompassing
	14 luminal and 1 ERBB2(-)/ER(-) DCIS. Eight cases (8 of 57; 14\%)
	presented a TP53 mutation, all being amplifiers. Unsupervised analysis
	of gene expression profiles of 26 of the 57 DCIS showed that luminal
	and ERBB2-amplified, ER-negative cases clustered separately. We further
	investigated the effect of high and low copy number changes on gene
	expression. Strikingly, amplicons but also low copy number changes
	especially on 1q, 8q, and 16q in DCIS regulated the expression of
	a subset of genes in a very similar way to that recently described
	in invasive ductal carcinomas. CONCLUSIONS: These combined approaches
	show that the molecular heterogeneity of breast ductal carcinomas
	exists already in in situ lesions and further indicate that DCIS
	and invasive ductal carcinomas share genomic alterations with a similar
	effect on gene expression profile.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Non-biological experimental error routinely occurs in
	microarray data collected in different batches. It is often impossible
	to compare groups of samples from independent experiments because
	batch effects confound true gene expression differences. Existing
	methods can correct for batch effects only when samples from all
	biological groups are represented in every batch. RESULTS: In this
	report we describe a generalized empirical Bayes approach to correct
	for cross-experimental batch effects, allowing direct comparisons
	of gene expression between biological groups from independent experiments.
	The proposed experimental design uses identical reference samples
	in each batch in every experiment. These reference samples are from
	the same tissue as the experimental samples. This design with tissue
	matched reference samples allows a gene-by-gene correction to be
	performed using fewer arrays than currently available methods. We
	examine the effects of non-biological variation within a single experiment
	and between experiments. CONCLUSION: Batch correction has a significant
	impact on which genes are identified as differentially regulated.
	Using this method, gene expression in the blood of patients with
	Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy is shown to differ for hundreds of genes
	when compared to controls. The numbers of specific genes differ depending
	upon whether between experiment and/or between batch corrections
	are performed.},

	chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) and normal B cells (NBC) using
	three different microarray platforms, oligonucleotide arrays, cDNA

	Using this approach, we identified a number of genes that were consistently

	is important for determining the function of proteins. {P}revious
	works focused on predicting protein localization in {G}ram-negative
	bacteria obtained good results. {H}owever, these methods had relatively
	low accuracies for the localization of extracellular proteins. {T}his
	paper studies ways to improve the accuracy for predicting extracellular
	localization in {G}ram-negative bacteria. {RESULTS}: {W}e have developed
	a system for predicting the subcellular localization of proteins
	for {G}ram-negative bacteria based on amino acid subalphabets and
	a combination of multiple support vector machines. {T}he recall of
	the extracellular site and overall recall of our predictor reach
	86.0\% and 89.8\%, respectively, in 5-fold cross-validation. {T}o
	the best of our knowledge, these are the most accurate results for

	and toxicological, as well as physicochemical properties of their
	principal ingredients, have been used as the basis for formulating
	{TCM} multi-herb prescriptions. {T}hese properties are used in this
	work to develop a computer program for predicting whether a multi-herb
	recipe is a valid {TCM} prescription. {T}his program is based on
	a statistical learning method, support vector machine ({SVM}), and
	it is trained by using 575 well-known {TCM} prescriptions and 1961
	non-{TCM} recipes generated by random combination of {TCM} herbs.
	{T}esting results by using 72 well-known {TCM} prescriptions and
	5039 non-{TCM} recipes showed that 73.6\% of the {TCM} prescriptions
	and 99.9\% of non-{TCM} recipes are correctly classified by this

	with Affymetrix Human U133a GeneChips, the expression of 22000 transcripts
	from total RNA of frozen tumour samples from 286 lymph-node-negative
	patients who had not received adjuvant systemic treatment. FINDINGS:
	In a training set of 115 tumours, we identified a 76-gene signature
	consisting of 60 genes for patients positive for oestrogen receptors
	(ER) and 16 genes for ER-negative patients. This signature showed
	93\% sensitivity and 48\% specificity in a subsequent independent
	testing set of 171 lymph-node-negative patients. The gene profile
	was highly informative in identifying patients who developed distant
	metastases within 5 years (hazard ratio 5.67 [95\% CI 2.59-12.4]),
	even when corrected for traditional prognostic factors in multivariate
	analysis (5.55 [2.46-12.5]). The 76-gene profile also represented
	a strong prognostic factor for the development of metastasis in the
	subgroups of 84 premenopausal patients (9.60 [2.28-40.5]), 87 postmenopausal
	patients (4.04 [1.57-10.4]), and 79 patients with tumours of 10-20
	mm (14.1 [3.34-59.2]), a group of patients for whom prediction of
	prognosis is especially difficult. INTERPRETATION: The identified
	signature provides a powerful tool for identification of patients
	at high risk of distant recurrence. The ability to identify patients
	who have a favourable prognosis could, after independent confirmation,
	allow clinicians to avoid adjuvant systemic therapy or to choose
	less aggressive therapeutic options.},

	based classification of phenotypes.},
  journal = {BMC Bioinformatics},
  year = {2005},
  volume = {6},
  pages = {265},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: The extensive use of DNA microarray technology in the
	characterization of the cell transcriptome is leading to an ever
	increasing amount of microarray data from cancer studies. Although
	similar questions for the same type of cancer are addressed in these
	different studies, a comparative analysis of their results is hampered
	by the use of heterogeneous microarray platforms and analysis methods.
	RESULTS: In contrast to a meta-analysis approach where results of
	different studies are combined on an interpretative level, we investigate
	here how to directly integrate raw microarray data from different
	studies for the purpose of supervised classification analysis. We
	use median rank scores and quantile discretization to derive numerically
	comparable measures of gene expression from different platforms.
	These transformed data are then used for training of classifiers
	based on support vector machines. We apply this approach to six publicly
	available cancer microarray gene expression data sets, which consist
	of three pairs of studies, each examining the same type of cancer,
	i.e. breast cancer, prostate cancer or acute myeloid leukemia. For
	each pair, one study was performed by means of cDNA microarrays and
	the other by means of oligonucleotide microarrays. In each pair,
	high classification accuracies (> 85\%) were achieved with training
	and testing on data instances randomly chosen from both data sets
	in a cross-validation analysis. To exemplify the potential of this
	cross-platform classification analysis, we use two leukemia microarray
	data sets to show that important genes with regard to the biology
	of leukemia are selected in an integrated analysis, which are missed
	in either single-set analysis. CONCLUSION: Cross-platform classification
	of multiple cancer microarray data sets yields discriminative gene
	expression signatures that are found and validated on a large number
	of microarray samples, generated by different laboratories and microarray
	technologies. Predictive models generated by this approach are better
	validated than those generated on a single data set, while showing
	high predictive power and improved generalization performance.},

	The combination of protein and ligand information was facilitated
	through the design of target-ligand kernel functions that account
	for pairwise ligand and target similarity. The design and biological
	information content of such kernel functions was expected to play
	a major role for target-directed ligand prediction. Therefore, a
	variety of target-ligand kernels were implemented to capture different
	types of target information including sequence, secondary structure,
	tertiary structure, biophysical properties, ontologies, or structural
	taxonomy. These kernels were tested in ligand predictions for simulated
	orphan targets in two target protein systems characterized by the
	presence of different intertarget relationships. Surprisingly, although
	there were target- and set-specific differences in prediction rates
	for alternative target-ligand kernels, the performance of these kernels
	was overall similar and also similar to SVM linear combinations.
	Test calculations designed to better understand possible reasons
	for these observations revealed that ligand information provided
	by nearest neighbors of orphan targets significantly influenced SVM
	performance, much more so than the inclusion of protein information.
	As long as ligands of closely related neighbors of orphan targets
	were available for SVM learning, orphan target ligands could be well
	predicted, regardless of the type and sophistication of the kernel
	function that was used. These findings suggest simplified strategies
	for SVM-based ligand prediction for orphan targets.},

	Here, we describe a method to detect copy number variation using
	shotgun sequencing, CNV-seq. The method is based on a robust statistical
	model that describes the complete analysis procedure and allows the
	computation of essential confidence values for detection of CNV.
	Our results show that the number of reads, not the length of the
	reads is the key factor determining the resolution of detection.
	This favors the next-generation sequencing methods that rapidly produce
	large amount of short reads. CONCLUSION: Simulation of various sequencing
	methods with coverage between 0.1x to 8x show overall specificity
	between 91.7 - 99.9\%, and sensitivity between 72.2 - 96.5\%. We

  abstract = {Functional relationships between proteins that do not share global
	structure similarity can be established by detecting their ligand-binding-site
	similarity. For a large-scale comparison, it is critical to accurately
	and efficiently assess the statistical significance of this similarity.
	Here, we report an efficient statistical model that supports local
	sequence order independent ligand-binding-site similarity searching.
	Most existing statistical models only take into account the matching
	vertices between two sites that are defined by a fixed number of
	points. In reality, the boundary of the binding site is not known
	or is dependent on the bound ligand making these approaches limited.
	To address these shortcomings and to perform binding-site mapping
	on a genome-wide scale, we developed a sequence-order independent
	profile-profile alignment (SOIPPA) algorithm that is able to detect
	local similarity between unknown binding sites a priori. The SOIPPA
	scoring integrates geometric, evolutionary and physical information
	into a unified framework. However, this imposes a significant challenge
	in assessing the statistical significance of the similarity because
	the conventional probability model that is based on fixed-point matching
	cannot be applied. Here we find that scores for binding-site matching
	by SOIPPA follow an extreme value distribution (EVD). Benchmark studies
	show that the EVD model performs at least two-orders faster and is
	more accurate than the non-parametric statistical method in the previous
	SOIPPA version. Efficient statistical analysis makes it possible
	to apply SOIPPA to genome-based drug discovery. Consequently, we
	have applied the approach to the structural genome of Mycobacterium
	tuberculosis to construct a protein-ligand interaction network. The
	network reveals highly connected proteins, which represent suitable
	targets for promiscuous drugs.},

  volume = {9},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: There is an urgent need for new prognostic markers of
	breast cancer metastases to ensure that newly diagnosed patients
	receive appropriate therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the
	potential value of gene expression signatures in assessing the risk
	of developing distant metastases. However, due to the small sample
	sizes of individual studies, the overlap among signatures is almost
	zero and their predictive power is often limited. Integrating microarray
	data from multiple studies in order to increase sample size is therefore
	a promising approach to the development of more robust prognostic
	tests. RESULTS: In this study, by using a highly stable data aggregation
	procedure based on expression comparisons, we have integrated three
	independent microarray gene expression data sets for breast cancer
	and identified a structured prognostic signature consisting of 112
	genes organized into 80 pair-wise expression comparisons. A classical
	likelihood ratio test based on these comparisons, essentially weighted
	voting, achieves 88.6\% sensitivity and 54.6\% specificity in an
	independent external test set of 154 samples. The test is highly
	informative in assessing the risk of developing distant metastases
	within five years (hazard ratio 9.3 with 95\% CI 2.9-29.9). CONCLUSION:
	Rank-based features provide a stable way to integrate patient data
	from separate microarray studies due to invariance to data normalization,
	and such features can be combined into a useful predictor of distant
	metastases in breast cancer within a statistical modeling framework
	which begins to capture gene-gene interactions. Upon further confirmation
	on large-scale independent data, such prognostic signatures and tests
	could provide a powerful tool to guide adjuvant systemic treatment
	that could greatly reduce the cost of breast cancer treatment, both
	in terms of toxic side effects and health care expenditures.},

	that can potentially be presented to CD8+ T cells (TCD8+), only a
	small fraction induce measurable responses in association with any
	given major histocompatibility complex class I allele. To design
	vaccines that elicit optimal TCD8+ responses, a thorough understanding
	of this phenomenon, known as immunodominance, is imperative. Here
	we review recent progress in unraveling the molecular and cellular
	basis for immunodominance. Of foremost importance is peptide binding
	to class I molecules; only approximately 1/200 of potential determinants
	bind at greater than the threshold affinity (Kd > 500 nM) associated
	with immunogenicity. Limitations in the TCD8+ repertoire render approximately
	half of these peptides nonimmunogenic, and inefficient antigen processing
	further thins the ranks by approximately four fifths. As a result,
	only approximately 1/2000 of the peptides in a foreign antigen expressed
	by an appropriate antigen presenting cell achieve immunodominant
	status with a given class I allele. A roughly equal fraction of peptides
	have subdominant status, i.e. they induce weak-to-nondetectable primary
	TCD8+ responses in the context of their natural antigen. Subdominant
	determinants may be expressed at or above levels of immunodominant
	determinants, at least on antigen presenting cells in vitro. The
	immunogenicity of subdominant determinants is often limited by immunodomination:
	suppression mediated by TCD8+ specific for immunodominant determinants.
	Immunodomination is a central feature of TCD8+ responses, as it even
	occurs among clones responding to the same immunodominant determinant.
	Little is known about how immunodominant and subdominant determinants
	are distinguished by the TCD8+ repertoire, or how (and why) immunodomination
	occurs, but new tools are available to address these questions.},

	to genetic studies promises to improve sensitivity to detect CNVs
	as well as inversions, indels, and SNPs. New computational approaches
	are needed to systematically detect these variants from genome sequence

	based on paired-end read mapping (PEM) as reported previously by
	Tuzun et al. and Korbel et al. Due to limitations of the PEM approach,
	some classes of CNVs are difficult to ascertain, including large
	insertions and variants located within complex genomic regions. To
	overcome these limitations, we developed a method for CNV detection
	using read depth of coverage. Event-wise testing (EWT) is a method
	based on significance testing. In contrast to standard segmentation
	algorithms that typically operate by performing likelihood evaluation
	for every point in the genome, EWT works on intervals of data points,
	rapidly searching for specific classes of events. Overall false-positive
	rate is controlled by testing the significance of each possible event
	and adjusting for multiple testing. Deletions and duplications detected
	in an individual genome by EWT are examined across multiple genomes
	to identify polymorphism between individuals. We estimated error
	rates using simulations based on real data, and we applied EWT to
	the analysis of chromosome 1 from paired-end shotgun sequence data
	(30x) on five individuals. Our results suggest that analysis of read
	depth is an effective approach for the detection of CNVs, and it
	captures structural variants that are refractory to established PEM-based

	Here, we present a novel diffusion-based framework that builds on

	it in several important ways. Specifically, we enhance the Rankprop
	algorithm to account for the presence of multiple paralogs, utilize
	PPI, and consider multiple (>2) species in parallel. We comprehensively
	benchmarked our framework using a variety of training datasets and
	experimental settings. The results, based on the yeast, fly and human

	a small subset of variations relevant to the protein pathogenicity
	(function). {O}n this basis, these sequences represent a model system

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: A variety of methods for prediction of peptide binding
	to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) have been proposed. These
	methods are based on binding motifs, binding matrices, hidden Markov
	models (HMM), or artificial neural networks (ANN). There has been
	little prior work on the comparative analysis of these methods. MATERIALS
	AND METHODS: We performed a comparison of the performance of six
	methods applied to the prediction of two human MHC class I molecules,
	including binding matrices and motifs, ANNs, and HMMs. RESULTS: The
	selection of the optimal prediction method depends on the amount
	of available data (the number of peptides of known binding affinity
	to the MHC molecule of interest), the biases in the data set and
	the intended purpose of the prediction (screening of a single protein
	versus mass screening). When little or no peptide data are available,
	binding motifs are the most useful alternative to random guessing
	or use of a complete overlapping set of peptides for selection of
	candidate binders. As the number of known peptide binders increases,
	binding matrices and HMM become more useful predictors. ANN and HMM
	are the predictive methods of choice for MHC alleles with more than
	100 known binding peptides. CONCLUSION: The ability of bioinformatic
	methods to reliably predict MHC binding peptides, and thereby potential
	T-cell epitopes, has major implications for clinical immunology,
	particularly in the area of vaccine design.},

  abstract = { We study the non-negative garrotte estimator from three different
	aspects: consistency, computation and flexibility. We argue that
	the non-negative garrotte is a general procedure that can be used
	in combination with estimators other than the original least squares
	estimator as in its original form. In particular, we consider using
	the lasso, the elastic net and ridge regression along with ordinary
	least squares as the initial estimate in the non-negative garrotte.
	We prove that the non-negative garrotte has the nice property that,
	with probability tending to 1, the solution path contains an estimate
	that correctly identifies the set of important variables and is consistent
	for the coefficients of the important variables, whereas such a property
	may not be valid for the initial estimators. In general, we show
	that the non-negative garrotte can turn a consistent estimate into
	an estimate that is not only consistent in terms of estimation but
	also in terms of variable selection. We also show that the non-negative
	garrotte has a piecewise linear solution path. Using this fact, we
	propose an efficient algorithm for computing the whole solution path
	for the non-negative garrotte. Simulations and a real example demonstrate
	that the non-negative garrotte is very effective in improving on
	the initial estimator in terms of variable selection and estimation
	accuracy. Copyright 2007 Royal Statistical Society.},

	{METHOD}: {T}his article introduces the application of string kernels

	kernel approach used in conjunction with support vector machines
	has been shown to achieve good performance in text categorisation

	for classifying the quaternary structure from the primary sequences.
	{R}esults: {B}oth of the support vector machine ({SVM}) and the covariant
	discriminant algorithms have been first introduced to predict quaternary
	structure properties from the protein primary sequences. {T}he amino
	acid composition and the auto-correlation functions based on the

	into account in the algorithms. {W}e have analyzed 472 amino acid
	indices and selected the four amino acid indices as the examples,
	which have the best performance. {T}hus the five attribute parameter
	data sets ({COMP}, {FASG}, {NISK}, {WOLS} and {KYTJ}) were established
	from the protein primary sequences. {T}he {COMP} attribute data set
	is composed of amino acid composition, and the {FASG}, {NISK}, {WOLS}

	the quaternary structure information. {C}ompared with previous {R}obert

  abstract = {An increasing attention has been dedicated to the characterization
	of complex networks within the protein world. This work is reporting
	how we uncovered networked structures that reflected the structural
	similarities among protein binding sites. First, a 211 binding sites
	dataset has been compiled by removing the redundant proteins in the
	Protein Ligand Database (PLD) (http://www-mitchell.ch.cam.ac.uk/pld/).
	Using a clique detection algorithm we have performed all-against-all
	binding site comparisons among the 211 available ones. Within the
	set of nodes representing each binding site an edge was added whenever
	a pair of binding sites had a similarity higher than a threshold
	value. The generated similarity networks revealed that many nodes
	had few links and only few were highly connected, but due to the
	limited data available it was not possible to definitively prove
	a scale-free architecture. Within the same dataset, the binding site
	similarity networks were compared with the networks of sequence and
	fold similarity networks. In the protein world, indications were
	found that structure is better conserved than sequence, but on its
	own, sequence was better conserved than the subset of functional
	residues forming the binding site. Because a binding site is strongly
	linked with protein function, the identification of protein binding
	site similarity networks could accelerate the functional annotation
	of newly identified genes. In view of this we have discussed several
	potential applications of binding site similarity networks, such
	as the construction of novel binding site classification databases,
	as well as the implications for protein molecular design in general
	and computational chemogenomics in particular.},

	benchmarked 13 different descriptor types in fold identification
	experiments in a highly diverse set of protein sequences. {T}he relevant
	descriptors were related to the fold class membership by using simple
	similarity measures in the descriptor spaces, such as the cosine
	angle. {O}ur results revealed that the three best-performing sets
	of descriptors were the sequence-alignment-based descriptor using
	{PSI}-{BLAST} e-values, the descriptors based on the alignment of
	secondary structural elements ({SSEA}), and the descriptors based
	on the occurrence of {PROSITE} functional motifs. {I}n a second phase,
	the three top-performing descriptors were combined to obtain a final
	method with improved performance, which we named {D}esc{F}old. {C}lass
	membership was predicted by {S}upport {V}ector {M}achine ({SVM})
	learning. {I}n comparison with the individual {PSI}-{BLAST}-based
	descriptor, the rate of remote homology identification increased
	from 33.7% to 46.3%. {W}e found out that the composite set of descriptors
	was able to identify the true remote homolog for nearly every sixth
	sequence at the 95% confidence level, or some 10% more than a single

	against several other state-of-the-art fold recognition algorithms
	for the 172 {L}ive{B}ench-8 targets, and we concluded that it was
	able to add value to the existing techniques by providing a confident

  pages = {2541},
  abstract = {Sparsity or parsimony of statistical models is crucial for their proper
	interpretations, as in sciences and social sciences. Model selection
	is a commonly used method to find such models, but usually involves
	a computationally heavy combinatorial search. Lasso (Tibshirani,
	1996) is now being used as a computationally feasible alternative
	to model selection. Therefore it is important to study Lasso for
	model selection purposes.
	
	
	In this paper, we prove that a single condition, which we call the
	Irrepresentable Condition, is almost necessary and sufficient for
	Lasso to select the true model both in the classical fixed p setting
	and in the large p setting as the sample size n gets large. Based
	on these results, sufficient conditions that are verifiable in practice
	are given to relate to previous works and help applications of Lasso
	for feature selection and sparse representation.
	
	
	This Irrepresentable Condition, which depends mainly on the covariance
	of the predictor variables, states that Lasso selects the true model
	consistently if and (almost) only if the predictors that are not
	in the true model are "irrepresentable" (in a sense to be clarified)
	by predictors that are in the true model. Furthermore, simulations
	are carried out to provide insights and understanding of this result.},

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {W}ith an overwhelming amount of textual information
	in molecular biology and biomedicine, there is a need for effective
	and efficient literature mining and knowledge discovery that can
	help biologists to gather and make use of the knowledge encoded in
	text documents. {I}n order to make organized and structured information
	available, automatically recognizing biomedical entity names becomes
	critical and is important for information retrieval, information
	extraction and automated knowledge acquisition. {RESULTS}: {I}n this
	paper, we present a named entity recognition system in the biomedical
	domain, called {P}ower{B}io{NE}. {I}n order to deal with the special
	phenomena of naming conventions in the biomedical domain, we propose
	various evidential features: (1) word formation pattern; (2) morphological
	pattern, such as prefix and suffix; (3) part-of-speech; (4) head
	noun trigger; (5) special verb trigger and (6) name alias feature.
	{A}ll the features are integrated effectively and efficiently through
	a hidden {M}arkov model ({HMM}) and a {HMM}-based named entity recognizer.
	{I}n addition, a k-{N}earest {N}eighbor (k-{NN}) algorithm is proposed
	to resolve the data sparseness problem in our system. {F}inally,
	we present a pattern-based post-processing to automatically extract
	rules from the training data to deal with the cascaded entity name
	phenomenon. {F}rom our best knowledge, {P}ower{B}io{NE} is the first
	system which deals with the cascaded entity name phenomenon. {E}valuation
	shows that our system achieves the {F}-measure of 66.6 and 62.2 on
	the 23 classes of {GENIA} {V}3.0 and {V}1.1, respectively. {I}n particular,
	our system achieves the {F}-measure of 75.8 on the "protein" class
	of {GENIA} {V}3.0. {F}or comparison, our system outperforms the best
	published result by 7.8 on {GENIA} {V}1.1, without help of any dictionaries.
	{I}t also shows that our {HMM} and the k-{NN} algorithm outperform
	other models, such as back-off {HMM}, linear interpolated {HMM},
	support vector machines, {C}4.5, {C}4.5 rules and {RIPPER}, by effectively
	capturing the local context dependency and resolving the data sparseness
	problem. {M}oreover, evaluation on {GENIA} {V}3.0 shows that the
	post-processing for the cascaded entity name phenomenon improves
	the {F}-measure by 3.9. {F}inally, error analysis shows that about
	half of the errors are caused by the strict annotation scheme and
	the annotation inconsistency in the {GENIA} corpus. {T}his suggests
	that our system achieves an acceptable {F}-measure of 83.6 on the
	23 classes of {GENIA} {V}3.0 and in particular 86.2 on the "protein"
	class, without help of any dictionaries. {W}e think that a {F}-measure
	of 90 on the 23 classes of {GENIA} {V}3.0 and in particular 92 on
	the "protein" class, can be achieved through refining of the annotation
	scheme in the {GENIA} corpus, such as flexible annotation scheme
	and annotation consistency, and inclusion of a reasonable biomedical
	dictionary. {AVAILABILITY}: {A} demo system is available at http://textmining.i2r.a-star.edu.sg/{NLS}/demo.htm.

  abstract = {M{OTIVATION}: {O}ne problem with discriminant analysis of {DNA} microarray
	data is that each sample is represented by quite a large number of

	genes are, therefore, of much significance in microarray data analysis.
	{I}n the present study, a new criterion, called {LS} {B}ound measure,
	is proposed to address the gene selection problem. {T}he {LS} {B}ound
	measure is derived from leave-one-out procedure of {LS}-{SVM}s (least
	squares support vector machines), and as the upper bound for leave-one-out
	classification results it reflects to some extent the generalization
	performance of gene subsets. {RESULTS}: {W}e applied this {LS} {B}ound
	measure for gene selection on two benchmark microarray datasets:
	colon cancer and leukemia. {W}e also compared the {LS} {B}ound measure
	with other evaluation criteria, including the well-known {F}isher's
	ratio and {M}ahalanobis class separability measure, and other published
	gene selection algorithms, including {W}eighting factor and {SVM}
	{R}ecursive {F}eature {E}limination. {T}he strength of the {LS} {B}ound
	measure is that it provides gene subsets leading to more accurate

  abstract = {Classification of patient samples is an important aspect of cancer

	been successfully applied to microarray cancer diagnosis problems.
	{H}owever, one weakness of the {SVM} is that given a tumor sample,
	it only predicts a cancer class label but does not provide any estimate
	of the underlying probability. {W}e propose penalized logistic regression
	({PLR}) as an alternative to the {SVM} for the microarray cancer
	diagnosis problem. {W}e show that when using the same set of genes,
	{PLR} and the {SVM} perform similarly in cancer classification, but
	{PLR} has the advantage of additionally providing an estimate of
	the underlying probability. {O}ften a primary goal in microarray
	cancer diagnosis is to identify the genes responsible for the classification,
	rather than class prediction. {W}e consider two gene selection methods
	in this paper, univariate ranking ({UR}) and recursive feature elimination
	({RFE}). {E}mpirical results indicate that {PLR} combined with {RFE}
	tends to select fewer genes than other methods and also performs
	well in both cross-validation and test samples. {A} fast algorithm

	a grouping effect, where strongly correlated predictors tend to be

	when the number of predictors (p) is much bigger than the number

	variable selection method in the p n case. An algorithm called LARS-EN
	is proposed for computing elastic net regularization paths efficiently,
