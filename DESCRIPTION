Description: DEGraph implements recent hypothesis testing methods
  which directly assess whether a particular gene network is
  differentially expressed between two conditions. This is to be
  contrasted with the more classical two-step approaches which first
  test individual genes, then test gene sets for enrichment in
  differentially expressed genes. These recent methods take into
  account the topology of the network to yield more powerful detection
  procedures. DEGraph provides methods to easily test all KEGG 
  pathways for differential expression on any gene expression data set
  and tools to visualize the results.
